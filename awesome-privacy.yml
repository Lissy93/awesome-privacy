      wordOfWarning: >
        Where possible, choose a cross-platform and well established encryption method,
        so that you are never faced with not being able to access your files using your current system.<br>
        Although well-established encryption methods are usually very secure,
        if the password is not strong, then an adversary may be able to gain access to your files,
        with a powerful enough GPU.
        If your system is compromised, then the password may also be able to be
        skimmed with a keylogger or other similar malware, so take care to follow
        good basic security practices

        Email clients are the programs used to interact with the mail server.
        For hosted email, then the web and mobile clients provided by your email
        service are usually adequate, and may be the most secure option.
        For self-hosted email, you will need to install and configure mail clients for web, desktop or mobile.
        A benefit of using an IMAP client, is that you will always have an offline backup of all email messages
        (which can then be encrypted and archived), and many applications let you aggregate multiple mailboxes
        for convenience. Desktop mail clients are not vulnerable to the common browser attacks, that their web

      intro: >
        Revealing your real email address online can put you at risk.
        Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and
        still land in your primary inbox. This protects your real email address
        from being revealed.
        Aliases are generated automatically, the first time they are used.
        This approach lets you identify which provider leaked your email address,
        and block an alias with 1-click.

        Now more than ever we are relying on software to help with team collaboration.
        Unfortunately many popular options, such as
        [Slack](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/slack-privacy-settings-notifications),
        [Microsoft Teams](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/microsoft-teams-meeting-data-privacy),

        [Discord](https://cybernews.com/privacy/discord-privacy-tips-that-you-should-use-in-2020/)
        all come with some serious privacy implications.<br>
        Typical features of team collaboration software includes:
        instant messaging, closed and open group messaging, voice and video conference calling,
        file sharing/ file drop, and some level or scheduling functionality.

      wordOfWarning: |
        - Having many extensions installed raises entropy, causing your fingerprint to be more unique, hence making tracking easier.
        - Much of the functionality of the above addons can be applied without installing anything, by configuring browser settings yourself. For Firefox this is done in the user.js
        - Be careful when installing unfamiliar browser add-ons, since some can compromise your security and privacy. At the time of writing, the above list were all open source, verified and 'safe' extensions.
        - In most situations, only a few of the above extensions will be needed in combination.
        - See the [arkenfox wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions) for more information on the obsolescence and purposelessness of many popular extensions, and why you may only need a very limited set.

          ad-blocking. Running on dedicated hardware, with no hard drives.

      wordOfWarning: |
        - *A VPN does not make you anonymous - it merely changes your public IP address to that of your VPN provider, instead of your ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies / session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)*
        - *Logging - If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider can see (and mess with) all your traffic. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this ([VPN leaks](https://vpnleaks.com/)). See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more*
        - *IP Leaks - If configured incorrectly, your IP may be exposed through a DNS leak. This usually happens when your system is unknowingly accessing default DNS servers rather than the anonymous DNS servers assigned by an anonymity network or VPN. Read more: [What is a DNS leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html), [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com), [How to Fix a DNS Leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/how-to-fix-a-dns-leak.html)*
        - *Stealth - It will be visible to your adversary that you are using a VPN (usually from the IP address), but other system and browser data, can still reveal information about you and your device (such as your local time-zone, indicating which region you are operating from)*
        - *Many reviews are sponsored, and hence biased. Do your own research, or go with one of the above options*
        - *Using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) (or another [Mix Network](/5_Privacy_Respecting_Software.md#mix-networks)) may be a better option for anonimity*

      furtherInfo: |
        *While choosing a VPN, consider the following: Logging policy (logs are bad),
        Jurisdiction (avoid 5-eyes), Number of servers, availability and average load.
        Payment method (anonymous methods such as BTC, Monero or cash are better),
        Leak protection (1st-party DNS servers = good, and check if IPv6 is supported),
        protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard = good). Finally, usability of their apps,
        user reviews and download speeds.*

      notableMentions:
        If you don't trust a VPN provider not to keep logs, then you could self-host your own VPN.
        This gives you you total control, but at the cost of anonymity
        (since your cloud provider, will require your billing info).
        See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand), to learn more, and get started with running a VPN.
        [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79) provides flexible,
        secure and easy Linux VMs, (from $0.007/hour or $5/month),
        Here is a [1-click install script](http://dovpn.carlfriess.com/)for 
        on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79), by Carl Friess.

        Recently distributed self-hosted solutions for running your own VPNs have
        become more popular, with services like [Outline](https://getoutline.org/)
        letting you spin up your own instance and share it with friends and family.
        Since it's distributed, it is very resistant to blocking, and gives you
        world-wide access to the free and open internet. And since you have full
        control over the server, you can be confident that there is no logging or monitoring happening.
        However it comes at the cost of anonymity, especially if it's only you using your instance.

          Tor provides robust anonymity, allowing you to defend against surveillance, circumvent
          censorship and reduce tracking. It blocks trackers, resists fingerprinting and implements
          multi-layered encryption by default, meaning you can browse freely. Tor also allows access

          I2P offers great generic transports, it is well geared towards accessing hidden services,
          and has a couple of technical benefits over Tor: P2P friendly with unidirectional short-lived
          tunnels, it is packet-switched (instead of circuit-switched) with TCP and UDP, and continuously
          profiles peers, in order to select the best performing ones.
          I2P is less mature, but fully-distributed and self-organising, its smaller size means that it
          hasn't yet been blocked or DOSed much.

      wordOfWarning: |
        To provide low-latency browsing, Tor does not mix packets or generate cover traffic.
        If an adversary is powerful enough, theoretically they could either observe the entire network,
        or just the victims entry and exit nodes. It's worth mentioning, that even though your ISP
        can not see what you are doing, they will be able determine that you are using a mix net,
        to hide this - a VPN could be used as well.
        If you are doing anything which could put you at risk, then good OpSec is essential,
        as the authorities have traced criminals through the Tor network before,
        and [made arrests](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/how-german-and-us-authorities-took-down-the-owners-of-darknet-drug-emporium-wall-street-market).
        Don't let Tor provide you a false sense of security - be aware of information leaks through DNS, other programs or human error.
        Tor-supported browsers may might lag behind their upstream forks, and include exploitable unpatched issues.
        See [#19](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/issues/19)

        Note: The Tor network is run by the community.
        If you benefit from using it and would like to help sustain uncensored internet access for all,
        consider [running a Tor relay](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide)

      furtherInfo: |
        Tor, I2P and Freenet are all anonymity networks - but they work very differently and each is good for specific purposes.
        So a good and viable solution would be to use all of them, for different tasks.

        #### DNS Protocols

        DNS-over-TLS was proposed in [RTC-7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)
        by the IETF, then 2 years later, the DNS-over-HTTPS specification was outlined
        in [RFC8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484) in October '18.
        [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), is a protocol that authenticates communications
        between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing, through
        using cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the
        chosen DNS resolver, and haven't been tampered with. DNSCrypt is a well
        battle-tested protocol, that has been in use since 2013, and is still widely used.

          Enterprise firewall and router for protecting networks, built on the FreeBSD system.

      wordOfWarning: |
        There are different [types](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-firewalls)
        of firewalls, that are used in different circumstances.
        This does not omit the need to configure your operating systems defences.
        Follow these instructions to enable your firewall in
        [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off),
        [Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642), [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)
        and other [Linux distros](https://www.tecmint.com/start-stop-disable-enable-firewalld-iptables-firewall).

        Even when properly configured, having a firewall enabled does not guarantee
        bad network traffic can not get through and especially during boot if you
        don't have root privileges.

      intro: |
        There are a few different ways to block ads - browser-based ad-blockers,
        router-based / device blockers or VPN ad-blockers.
        Typically they work by taking a maintained list of hosts,
        and filtering each domain/ IP through it. Some also have other methods to
        detect certain content based on pattern matching

        An alternative option, is to use a cloud computing provider, and implement
        the syncing functionality yourself, and encrypt data locally before
        uploading it - this may work out cheaper in some situations.
        You could also run a local server that you physically own at a secondary location,
        that would mitigate the need to trust a third party cloud provider.
        Note that some knowledge in securing networks is required.

    - name: Metadata Removal
      intro: |
        [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)/ [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)
        is "data about data", this additional information attached to files can
        lead us to
        [share significantly more information than we intended](https://gizmodo.com/vice-magazine-just-accidentally-revealed-where-john-mca-5965295) to.

        For example, if you upload an image of a sunset to the internet, but don't remove the metadata,
        it [may reveal the location](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=1) (GPS lat + long)
        of where it was taken, the device is was taken on, precise camera data, details about modifications and the
        picture source + author. Social networks that remove metadata from your photos, often collect and store it,
        for their own use.
        This could obviously pose a security risk, and that is why it is recommended to strip out this data from a file before sharing.

        Alternatively, with [ImageMagic](https://imagemagick.org) installed, just run
        `convert -strip path/to/image.png` to remove all metadata.
        
        If you have [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) installed, then just go to `File --> Export As --> Export --> Advanced Options --> Uncheck the "Save EXIF data" option`.

        Often you need to perform meta data removal programmatically, as part of a script or automation process.

        There's no need to use a third-party tool. You can boot into a UNIX-based
        system, mount the disk you need to erase, and use a command to write it

        several times. This is a good way to wipe a disk, before selling or
        destroying it, to protect your data.

        Such as the [`dd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29) command,
        is a tool to convert and copy files, but running
        `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M` will quickly overwrite the whole disk with zeros.
        Or [badblocks](https://linux.die.net/man/8/badblocks) which is intended to search for all bad blocks,
        but can also be used to write zeros to a disk,
        by running `sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdd`.
        
        An effective method of erasing an SSD, it to use [hdparm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdparm)
        to issue a [secure erase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security)
        command, to your target storage device,

        Finally, [srm](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-srm/) can be
        use to securely remove files or directories, just run `srm -zsv /path/to/file`

      wordOfWarning: |
        It is not recommended to root, or flash your device with a custom ROM if you are not an advanced user.
        There are risks involved
        - Although the above ROMs omit Google, they do open up other security issues: Without DM-verity on the system partition, the file system *could* be tampered with, and no verified boot stack, the kernel/initramfs also *could* be edited. You should understand the risks, before proceeding to flash a custom ROM to your device
        - You will need to rely on updates from the community, which could be slower to be released - this may be an issue for a time-urgent, security-critical patch
        - It is also possible to brick your device, through interrupted install or bad software
        - Finally, rooting and flashing your device, will void your warranty

        Windows and MacOS have many features that violate your privacy.
        Microsoft and Apple are able to collect all your data (including, but not
        limited to: keystrokes, searches and mic input, calendar data, music,
        photos, credit card information and purchases, identity, passwords, contacts,
        conversations and location data). Microsoft Windows is also more susceptible
        to malware and viruses, than alternative systems.

        Switching to Linux is a great choice in terms of security and privacy -
        you don't need necessarily need to use a security distro, any well-maintained
        stable distro is going to be considerably better than a proprietary OS

      furtherInfo: |

        #### General Purpose Linux Distros
        If you do not want to use a specalist security-based distro, or you are
        new to Unix - then just switching to any well-maintained Linux distro,
        is going to be significantly more secure and private than Windows or Mac OS.
        Since it is open source, major distros are constantly being audited by
        members of the community. Linux does not give users admin rights by default -
        this makes is much less likely that your system could become infected with malware.
        And of course, there is no proprietary Microsoft or Apple software constantly
        monitoring everything you do.

        Some good distros to consider would be: **[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)**,
        **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)**, or **[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)**-
        all of which have a large community behind them. **[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)**
        (based of Arch) is a good option, with a simple install process, used by new comers,
        and expers alike.
        **[POP_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)** and **[PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/)**
        are reasonably new general purpose Linux, with a strong focus on privacy, but also
        very user-friendly with an intuitive interfac and install process.
        See [Detailed Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions).

        #### BSD
        BSD systems arguably have far superior network stacks.
        **[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)** is designed for maximum security —
        not just with its features, but with its implementation practices.
        It's a commonly used OS by banks and critical systems.
        **[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)** is more popular, and aims for high
        performance and ease of use.

        #### Windows
        Two alternative options for Windows users are Windows 10 AME (ameliorated)
        project and the LTSC stream.
        - **[Windows 10 AME](https://ameliorated.info/)** AME project aims at delivering
        a stable, non-intrusive yet fully functional build of Windows 10 to anyone,
        who requires the Windows operating system natively. Core applications, such
        as the included Edge web-browser, Windows Media Player, Cortana, as well as
        any appx applications (appx apps will no longer work), have also been successfully
        eliminated. The total size of removed files is about 2 GB. Comes as a pre-built
        ISO or option to build from scratch with de-bloat scripts. Strong, supportive
        community on Telegram.
        - **[Windows 10 LTSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/)**
        LTSC provides several security benefits over a standard Win 10 Installation.
        LTSC or Long Term Servicing Channel is a lightweight, low-cost Windows 10
        version, that is intended for specialized systems, and receives less regular
        feature updates. What makes it appealing, is that it doesn't come with any
        bloatware or non-essential applications, and needs to be configured from the
        ground up by the user. This gives you much better control over what is running
        on your system, ultimately improving security and privacy. It also includes
        several enterprise-grade
        [security features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/whats-new-windows-10-2019#security),
        which are not available in a standard Windows 10 instance. It does require
        some technical knowledge to get started with, but once setup should perform
        just as any other Windows 10 system. Note that you should only download the
        LTSC ISO from the Microsoft's
        [official page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) 


        #### Improve the Security and Privacy of your current OS
        After installing your new operating system, or if you have chosen to stick
        with your current OS, there are a couple of things you can do to improve security.
        See: [Windows 10 security guide](https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/windows-10-security-guide/privacy),
        [Mac OS security guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/mac-privacy-tips/) or

        For that reason it is recommended not to have these devices in your house.

        It's a small app that runs on a Pi, and gives you more control over your smart assistants, for both customisation and privacy.

        For a desktop-based assistant, see

        and [Jarvis](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis) for MacOS.

          Uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect privacy cryptographic technique,
          that allows two users to transact without ever revealing their true identity

          Z transactions and addresses are private and T transactions and addresses
          are transparent like Bitcoin.
      furtherInfo: |
        It is still possible to use currencies that have a public ledger 'privately',
        but you will need to take great care not to cause any transactions to be
        linked with your identity or activity. For example, avoid exchanges that
        require KYC, and consider using a service such as
        [Local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.net).
        If you use a [Bitcoin ATM](https://coinatmradar.com), then take care to not
        be physically tracked (CCTV, phone location, card payments etc)

      wordOfWarning: |
        Not all cryptocurrencies are anonymous, and without using a privacy-focused coin,
        a record of your transaction will live on a publicly available distributed ledger, forever.
        If you send of receive multiple payments, ensure you switch up addresses or use a mixer,
        to make it harder for anyone trying to trace your transactions.
        Cryptocurrencies that allow private and public transactions may reveal meta
        data about your transactions and balances when funds are moving from
        private to public addresses which can compromise your privacy with methods
        similar to a knapsack problem.

        Always store private keys somewhere safe, but offline

        Note: Cryptocurrency prices can go down. Storing any wealth in crypto may result in losses.
        If you are new to digital currencies - do your research first, don't invest more than you can afford to loose,
        and be very weary crypto-related scams are very common. as is and cryptocurrency-related malware.

Neither an observer nor the participants can determine which output belongs to which input. This makes it difficult for outside parties to trace where a particular coin originated from and where it was sent to, which greatly improves privacy. Since it's trustless, the CoinJoin coordinator cannot breach the privacy of the participants. Wasabi is compatible with cold storage and hardware wallets, including OpenCard and Trezor.

There are native apps for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and iOS, but Trezor is also compatible with other wallets, such as Wasabi. You can back the Trezor up, either by writing down the seed, or by duplicating it to another device.

A decentralized server indexes ledger transactions, meaning it's fast and doesn't require much disk space.

      wordOfWarning: |
        Note that credit card providers heavily track transaction metadata, which build
        up a detailed picture of each persons spending habits. This is done both to
        provide improved fraud alerts, but also because the data is extremely valuable
        and is often 'anonymized' and sold to 3rd parties. Hence your privacy is degraded
        if these cards are used for daily transactions
      furtherInfo: |
        Paying for goods and services is a good example of where privacy and security conflict;
        the most secure option would be to pay with credit card, since most providers include
        comprehensive fraud protection, whereas the most private option would be to pay using
        crypto currency or cash, since neither can be easily tied back to your identity.

        [cost of our privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services).
        
        Social networks are built on the principle of sharing - but you, the user
        should be able to choose with whom you share what, and that is what the
        following sites aim to do.

      furtherInfo: |
        The content on many of these smaller sites tends to be more *niche*.
        To continue using Twitter, there are a couple of
        [tweaks](https://www.offensiveprivacy.com/blog/twitter-privacy),
        that will improve security. For Reddit, use a privacy-respecting client -
        such as [Reditr](http://reditr.com/).
        Other main-stream social networking sites do not respect your privacy,
        so should be avoided, but if you choose to keep using them see

        #### YouTube Proxies
        The content on many of the smaller video sites, often just doesn't compare to YouTube.
        So another alternative, is to access YouTube through a proxy client, which reduces what Google can track.
        - Good options are: [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) (web), [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks) (web), [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) (Android), [YouTube++](https://iosninja.io/ipa-library/download-youtube-plus-ipa-ios) (iOS)
        - Or download videos with [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) (cli) or [youtube-dl-gui](https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui) (gui). For just audio, there is [PodSync](https://podsync.net/)

        #### Video Search Engines
        [Petey Vid](https://www.peteyvid.com) is a non-biased video search engine.
        Unlike normal search engines it indexes videos from a lot of sources,
        including Twitter, Veoh, Instagram, Twitch, MetaCafe, Minds, BitChute,
        Brighteon, D-Tube, PeerTube, and many others.
