      wordOfWarning: >
        Where possible, choose a cross-platform and well established encryption method,
        so that you are never faced with not being able to access your files using your current system.<br>
        Although well-established encryption methods are usually very secure,
        if the password is not strong, then an adversary may be able to gain access to your files,
        with a powerful enough GPU.
        If your system is compromised, then the password may also be able to be
        skimmed with a keylogger or other similar malware, so take care to follow
        good basic security practices

          secure native mobile apps and desktop email clients, anonymous signup, and an encrypted calendar. Tuta has a
          full-featured free plan and premium subscription plans allowing for
          custom domains (starting at $3/month). Tuta
          [does not use OpenPGP](https://tuta.com/blog/posts/differences-email-encryption/)
          like other encrypted mail providers, instead they use a standardized, hybrid method
          consisting of symmetrical and asymmetrical algorithms (with AES256, and RSA 2048 
          or ECC (x25519) and Kyber-1024). This causes compatibility issues when communicating with contacts
          using PGP. But it does allow them to encrypt much more of the header data (body,
          attachments, subject lines, and sender names etc) which PGP mail providers cannot do. The recent upgrades
          to Tuta's encryption algorithm makes data stored and sent with their service safe against attacks 
          posed by quantum computers.

        - When using an end-to-end encryption technology like OpenPGP, some metadata
        in the email header will not be encrypted.
        - OpenPGP also does not support Forward secrecy, which means if either
        your or the recipient's private key is ever stolen, all previous messages
        encrypted with it will be exposed. You should take great care to keep your
        private keys safe.

      intro: >
        Email clients are the programs used to interact with the mail server.
        For hosted email, then the web and mobile clients provided by your email
        service are usually adequate, and may be the most secure option.
        For self-hosted email, you will need to install and configure mail clients for web, desktop or mobile.
        A benefit of using an IMAP client, is that you will always have an offline backup of all email messages
        (which can then be encrypted and archived), and many applications let you aggregate multiple mailboxes
        for convenience. Desktop mail clients are not vulnerable to the common browser attacks, that their web
        app counterparts are.

        Revealing your real email address online can put you at risk.
        Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and
        still land in your primary inbox. This protects your real email address
        from being revealed.
        Aliases are generated automatically, the first time they are used.
        This approach lets you identify which provider leaked your email address,
        and block an alias with 1-click.

          Secure group communications, with the option to be used over Tor or I2P. Fast
          intuitive group and 1-to-1 chats with text and rich media using decentralized
          chat rooms, with a mail feature for delivering messages to offline contacts.
          A channels feature makes it possible for members of different teams to stay
          up-to-date with each other, and to share files. Also includes built-in forums,
          link aggregations, file sharing and voice and video calling. RetroShare is a
          bit more complex to use than some alternatives, and the UI is quite *retro*,
          so may not be appropriate for a non-technical team.

          An IRC-based solution is another option, being decentralized there is no point
          of failure, and it's easy to self-host. However it's important to keep security
          in mind while configuring your IRC instance and ensure that channels are properly
          encrypted - IRC tends to be better for open communications. There's a variety of

      wordOfWarning: |
        - Having many extensions installed raises entropy, causing your fingerprint to be more unique, hence making tracking easier.
        - Much of the functionality of the above addons can be applied without installing anything, by configuring browser settings yourself. For Firefox this is done in the user.js
        - Be careful when installing unfamiliar browser add-ons, since some can compromise your security and privacy. At the time of writing, the above list were all open source, verified and 'safe' extensions.
        - In most situations, only a few of the above extensions will be needed in combination.
        - See the [arkenfox wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions) for more information on the obsolescence and purposelessness of many popular extensions, and why you may only need a very limited set.

      wordOfWarning: |
        - *A VPN does not make you anonymous - it merely changes your public IP address to that of your VPN provider, instead of your ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies / session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)*
        - *Logging - If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider can see (and mess with) all your traffic. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this ([VPN leaks](https://vpnleaks.com/)). See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more*
        - *IP Leaks - If configured incorrectly, your IP may be exposed through a DNS leak. This usually happens when your system is unknowingly accessing default DNS servers rather than the anonymous DNS servers assigned by an anonymity network or VPN. Read more: [What is a DNS leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html), [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com), [How to Fix a DNS Leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/how-to-fix-a-dns-leak.html)*
        - *Stealth - It will be visible to your adversary that you are using a VPN (usually from the IP address), but other system and browser data, can still reveal information about you and your device (such as your local time-zone, indicating which region you are operating from)*
        - *Many reviews are sponsored, and hence biased. Do your own research, or go with one of the above options*
        - *Using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) (or another [Mix Network](/5_Privacy_Respecting_Software.md#mix-networks)) may be a better option for anonimity*

      furtherInfo: |
        *While choosing a VPN, consider the following: Logging policy (logs are bad),
        Jurisdiction (avoid 5-eyes), Number of servers, availability and average load.
        Payment method (anonymous methods such as BTC, Monero or cash are better),
        Leak protection (1st-party DNS servers = good, and check if IPv6 is supported),
        protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard = good). Finally, usability of their apps,
        user reviews and download speeds.*

      notableMentions:
        If you don't trust a VPN provider not to keep logs, then you could self-host your own VPN.
        This gives you you total control, but at the cost of anonymity
        (since your cloud provider, will require your billing info).
        See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand), to learn more, and get started with running a VPN.

        Recently distributed self-hosted solutions for running your own VPNs have
        become more popular, with services like [Outline](https://getoutline.org/)
        letting you spin up your own instance and share it with friends and family.
        Since it's distributed, it is very resistant to blocking, and gives you
        world-wide access to the free and open internet. And since you have full
        control over the server, you can be confident that there is no logging or monitoring happening.
        However it comes at the cost of anonymity, especially if it's only you using your instance.

          profiles peers, in order to select the best performing ones.

      wordOfWarning: |
        To provide low-latency browsing, Tor does not mix packets or generate cover traffic.
        If an adversary is powerful enough, theoretically they could either observe the entire network,
        or just the victims entry and exit nodes. It's worth mentioning, that even though your ISP
        can not see what you are doing, they will be able determine that you are using a mix net,
        to hide this - a VPN could be used as well.
        If you are doing anything which could put you at risk, then good OpSec is essential,
        as the authorities have traced criminals through the Tor network before,
        and [made arrests](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/how-german-and-us-authorities-took-down-the-owners-of-darknet-drug-emporium-wall-street-market).
        Don't let Tor provide you a false sense of security - be aware of information leaks through DNS, other programs or human error.
        Tor-supported browsers may might lag behind their upstream forks, and include exploitable unpatched issues.
        See [#19](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/issues/19)

        Note: The Tor network is run by the community.
        If you benefit from using it and would like to help sustain uncensored internet access for all,
        consider [running a Tor relay](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide)

      furtherInfo: |
        Tor, I2P and Freenet are all anonymity networks - but they work very differently and each is good for specific purposes.
        So a good and viable solution would be to use all of them, for different tasks.

        #### DNS Protocols

        DNS-over-TLS was proposed in [RTC-7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)
        by the IETF, then 2 years later, the DNS-over-HTTPS specification was outlined
        in [RFC8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484) in October '18.
        [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), is a protocol that authenticates communications
        between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing, through
        using cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the
        chosen DNS resolver, and haven't been tampered with. DNSCrypt is a well
        battle-tested protocol, that has been in use since 2013, and is still widely used.

        A firewall is a program which monitors the incoming and outgoing traffic
        on your network, and blocks requests based on rules set during its configuration.
        Properly configured, a firewall can help protect against attempts to
        remotely access your computer, as well as control which applications
        can access which IPs.

      wordOfWarning: |
        There are different [types](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-firewalls)
        of firewalls, that are used in different circumstances.
        This does not omit the need to configure your operating systems defences.
        Follow these instructions to enable your firewall in
        [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off),
        [Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642), [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)
        and other [Linux distros](https://www.tecmint.com/start-stop-disable-enable-firewalld-iptables-firewall).

        Even when properly configured, having a firewall enabled does not guarantee
        bad network traffic can not get through and especially during boot if you
        don't have root privileges.

        An alternative option, is to use a cloud computing provider, and implement
        the syncing functionality yourself, and encrypt data locally before
        uploading it - this may work out cheaper in some situations.
        You could also run a local server that you physically own at a secondary location,
        that would mitigate the need to trust a third party cloud provider.
        Note that some knowledge in securing networks is required.

        For example, if you upload an image of a sunset to the internet, but don't remove the metadata,
        it [may reveal the location](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=1) (GPS lat + long)
        of where it was taken, the device is was taken on, precise camera data, details about modifications and the
        picture source + author. Social networks that remove metadata from your photos, often collect and store it,
        for their own use.
        This could obviously pose a security risk, and that is why it is recommended to strip out this data from a file before sharing.

        It's possible (but slower) to do this without a third-party tool.
        For Windows, right click on a file, and go to: `Properties --> Details --> Remove Properties --> Remove from this File --> Select All --> OK`.

        Alternatively, with [ImageMagic](https://imagemagick.org) installed, just run
        `convert -strip path/to/image.png` to remove all metadata.
        
        If you have [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) installed, then just go to `File --> Export As --> Export --> Advanced Options --> Uncheck the "Save EXIF data" option`.

        Often you need to perform meta data removal programmatically, as part of a script or automation process.

        There's no need to use a third-party tool. You can boot into a UNIX-based
        system, mount the disk you need to erase, and use a command to write it
        with arbitrary data. For best results, this process should be repeated
        several times. This is a good way to wipe a disk, before selling or
        destroying it, to protect your data.

        Such as the [`dd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29) command,
        is a tool to convert and copy files, but running
        `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M` will quickly overwrite the whole disk with zeros.
        Or [badblocks](https://linux.die.net/man/8/badblocks) which is intended to search for all bad blocks,
        but can also be used to write zeros to a disk,
        by running `sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdd`.
        
        An effective method of erasing an SSD, it to use [hdparm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdparm)
        to issue a [secure erase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security)
        command, to your target storage device,
        for this, see step-by-step instructions via: [wiki.kernel.org](https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase).
        
        Finally, [srm](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-srm/) can be
        use to securely remove files or directories, just run `srm -zsv /path/to/file`
        for a single pass over.

        It is not recommended to root, or flash your device with a custom ROM if you are not an advanced user.
        There are risks involved
        - Although the above ROMs omit Google, they do open up other security issues: Without DM-verity on the system partition, the file system *could* be tampered with, and no verified boot stack, the kernel/initramfs also *could* be edited. You should understand the risks, before proceeding to flash a custom ROM to your device
        - You will need to rely on updates from the community, which could be slower to be released - this may be an issue for a time-urgent, security-critical patch
        - It is also possible to brick your device, through interrupted install or bad software
        - Finally, rooting and flashing your device, will void your warranty

      furtherInfo: |

        #### General Purpose Linux Distros
        If you do not want to use a specalist security-based distro, or you are
        new to Unix - then just switching to any well-maintained Linux distro,
        is going to be significantly more secure and private than Windows or Mac OS.
        Since it is open source, major distros are constantly being audited by
        members of the community. Linux does not give users admin rights by default -
        this makes is much less likely that your system could become infected with malware.
        And of course, there is no proprietary Microsoft or Apple software constantly
        monitoring everything you do.

        Some good distros to consider would be: **[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)**,
        **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)**, or **[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)**-
        all of which have a large community behind them. **[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)**
        (based of Arch) is a good option, with a simple install process, used by new comers,
        and expers alike.
        **[POP_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)** and **[PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/)**
        are reasonably new general purpose Linux, with a strong focus on privacy, but also
        very user-friendly with an intuitive interfac and install process.
        See [Detailed Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions).

        #### BSD
        BSD systems arguably have far superior network stacks.
        **[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)** is designed for maximum security —
        not just with its features, but with its implementation practices.
        It's a commonly used OS by banks and critical systems.
        **[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)** is more popular, and aims for high
        performance and ease of use.

        #### Windows
        Two alternative options for Windows users are Windows 10 AME (ameliorated)
        project and the LTSC stream.
        - **[Windows 10 AME](https://ameliorated.info/)** AME project aims at delivering
        a stable, non-intrusive yet fully functional build of Windows 10 to anyone,
        who requires the Windows operating system natively. Core applications, such
        as the included Edge web-browser, Windows Media Player, Cortana, as well as
        any appx applications (appx apps will no longer work), have also been successfully
        eliminated. The total size of removed files is about 2 GB. Comes as a pre-built
        ISO or option to build from scratch with de-bloat scripts. Strong, supportive
        community on Telegram.
        - **[Windows 10 LTSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/)**
        LTSC provides several security benefits over a standard Win 10 Installation.
        LTSC or Long Term Servicing Channel is a lightweight, low-cost Windows 10
        version, that is intended for specialized systems, and receives less regular
        feature updates. What makes it appealing, is that it doesn't come with any
        bloatware or non-essential applications, and needs to be configured from the
        ground up by the user. This gives you much better control over what is running
        on your system, ultimately improving security and privacy. It also includes
        several enterprise-grade
        [security features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/whats-new-windows-10-2019#security),
        which are not available in a standard Windows 10 instance. It does require
        some technical knowledge to get started with, but once setup should perform
        just as any other Windows 10 system. Note that you should only download the
        LTSC ISO from the Microsoft's
        [official page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) 


        #### Improve the Security and Privacy of your current OS
        After installing your new operating system, or if you have chosen to stick
        with your current OS, there are a couple of things you can do to improve security.
        See: [Windows 10 security guide](https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/windows-10-security-guide/privacy),
        [Mac OS security guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/mac-privacy-tips/) or

        (The above software was last tested on 01/05/20).
        Many of the above tools are not necessary or suitable for beginners,
        and can cause your system to break - only use software that you need,
        according to your threat model. Take care to only download from an
        official/ legitimate source, verify the executable before proceeding,
        and check reviews/ forums.
        Create a system restore point, before making any significant changes to
        your OS (such as disabling core features).
        
        From a security and privacy perspective, Linux may be a better option.

        For Microsoft Windows, Windows Defender provides totally adequate virus

        detecting/ removing threats on an infected machine, and are not recommended
        to be left running in the background, use portable editions where available.

        Many anti virus products have a history of introducing vulnerabilities themselves,
        and several of them seriously degrade the performance of your computer, as well as
        decrease your privacy. Never use a free anti-virus, and never trust the companies
        that offer free solutions, even if you pay for the premium package.
        This includes (but not limited to) Avast, AVG, McAfee and Kasperky.
        For AV to be effective, it needs intermate access to all areas of your PC,
        so it is important to go with a trusted vendor, and monitor its activity closely.

      furtherInfo: |
        It is still possible to use currencies that have a public ledger 'privately',
        but you will need to take great care not to cause any transactions to be
        linked with your identity or activity. For example, avoid exchanges that
        require KYC, and consider using a service such as
        [Local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.net).
        If you use a [Bitcoin ATM](https://coinatmradar.com), then take care to not
        be physically tracked (CCTV, phone location, card payments etc)

      wordOfWarning: |
        Not all cryptocurrencies are anonymous, and without using a privacy-focused coin,
        a record of your transaction will live on a publicly available distributed ledger, forever.
        If you send of receive multiple payments, ensure you switch up addresses or use a mixer,
        to make it harder for anyone trying to trace your transactions.
        Cryptocurrencies that allow private and public transactions may reveal meta
        data about your transactions and balances when funds are moving from
        private to public addresses which can compromise your privacy with methods
        similar to a knapsack problem.

        Always store private keys somewhere safe, but offline

        Note: Cryptocurrency prices can go down. Storing any wealth in crypto may result in losses.
        If you are new to digital currencies - do your research first, don't invest more than you can afford to loose,
        and be very weary crypto-related scams are very common. as is and cryptocurrency-related malware.

Your private key is generated on the device, and never leaves it, all transactions are signed by the Trezor, which ensures your wallet is safe from theft. There are native apps for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and iOS, but Trezor is also compatible with other wallets, such as Wasabi. You can back the Trezor up, either by writing down the seed, or by duplicating it to another device. It is simple and intuitive to use, but also incredibly customizable with a large range of advanced features.

Compatible with other wallets, so there is no tie-in, and funds can be recovered with your secret seed. It supports proof-checking to verify transactions using SPV, multi-sig, and add-ons for compatibility with hardware wallets. A decentralized server indexes ledger transactions, meaning it's fast and doesn't require much disk space. The potential security issue here would not be with the wallet, but rather your PC - you must ensure your computer is secure and your wallet has a long, strong passphrase to encrypt it with.

      wordOfWarning: |
        Note that credit card providers heavily track transaction metadata, which build
        up a detailed picture of each persons spending habits. This is done both to
        provide improved fraud alerts, but also because the data is extremely valuable
        and is often 'anonymized' and sold to 3rd parties. Hence your privacy is degraded
        if these cards are used for daily transactions
      furtherInfo: |
        Paying for goods and services is a good example of where privacy and security conflict;
        the most secure option would be to pay with credit card, since most providers include
        comprehensive fraud protection, whereas the most private option would be to pay using
        crypto currency or cash, since neither can be easily tied back to your identity.
