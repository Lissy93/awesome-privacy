## Intro

Large data-hungry corporations dominate the digital world but with little, or no respect for your privacy.
Migrating to open-source applications with a strong emphasis on privacy and security will help stop
corporations, governments, and hackers from logging, storing or selling your personal data.

support for media attachments and allows for high-quality voice and video calls.
It's cross-platform, open-source and totally free. Signal is
[recommended](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152)

### P2P Messaging

With [Peer-to-Peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) networks, there are no central server, so there is nothing that can be raided, shut-down or forced to turn over data. There are P2P networks available that are open source, E2E encrypted, routed through Tor services, totally anonymous and operate without the collection of metadata.

- **[<img src='https://oxen.io/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Oxen](https://oxen.io/)** - Oxen (previously Loki) is an open source set of tools that allow users to transact
and communicate anonymously and privately, through a decentralised, encrypted,
onion-based network.
Session is a desktop and mobile app that uses these private routing protocols to
secure messages, media and metadata.

### Encrypted Email

Email is not secure - your messages can be easily intercepted and read. Corporations scan the content of your mail, to build up a profile of you, either to show you targeted ads or to sell onto third-parties. Through the [Prism Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)), the government also has full access to your emails (if not end-to-end encrypted) - this applies to Gmail, Outlook Mail, Yahoo Mail, GMX, ZoHo, iCloud, AOL and more.<br><br> For a more details comparison of email providers, see [email-comparison.as93.net](https://email-comparison.as93.net/)

service and is based on simplicity without sacrificing security. It has a free
plan or a premium option for using custom domains (starting at $5/month).
ProtonMail requires no personally identifiable information for signup, they have
a [.onion](https://protonirockerxow.onion) server, for access via Tor, and they
accept anonymous payment: BTC and cash (as well as the normal credit card and PayPal).

secure native mobile apps and desktop email clients, anonymous signup, and an encrypted calendar. Tuta has a
full-featured free plan and premium subscription plans allowing for
custom domains (starting at $3/month). Tuta
[does not use OpenPGP](https://tuta.com/blog/posts/differences-email-encryption/)
like other encrypted mail providers, instead they use a standardized, hybrid method
consisting of symmetrical and asymmetrical algorithms (with AES256, and RSA 2048 
or ECC (x25519) and Kyber-1024). This causes compatibility issues when communicating with contacts
using PGP. But it does allow them to encrypt much more of the header data (body,
attachments, subject lines, and sender names etc) which PGP mail providers cannot do. The recent upgrades
to Tuta's encryption algorithm makes data stored and sent with their service safe against attacks 
posed by quantum computers.

### Email Clients

Email clients are the programs used to interact with the mail server. For hosted email, then the web and mobile clients provided by your email service are usually adequate, and may be the most secure option. For self-hosted email, you will need to install and configure mail clients for web, desktop or mobile. A benefit of using an IMAP client, is that you will always have an offline backup of all email messages (which can then be encrypted and archived), and many applications let you aggregate multiple mailboxes for convenience. Desktop mail clients are not vulnerable to the common browser attacks, that their web app counterparts are.

### Mail Forwarding

Revealing your real email address online can put you at risk. Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and still land in your primary inbox. This protects your real email address from being revealed. Aliases are generated automatically, the first time they are used. This approach lets you identify which provider leaked your email address, and block an alias with 1-click.

### Team Collaboration

Now more than ever we are relying on software to help with team collaboration. Unfortunately many popular options, such as [Slack](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/slack-privacy-settings-notifications), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/microsoft-teams-meeting-data-privacy), [Google for Work](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tracks-you-privacy/) and [Discord](https://cybernews.com/privacy/discord-privacy-tips-that-you-should-use-in-2020/) all come with some serious privacy implications.<br> Typical features of team collaboration software includes: instant messaging, closed and open group messaging, voice and video conference calling, file sharing/ file drop, and some level or scheduling functionality.

- **[<img src='https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wGn6UxVJUVWBOEAR_864Y_TG42iCsr8Ls3xmLoT4oOimSo6lk2_2gfBATqNDNmArKzQ' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat)** - Easy-to-deploy, self-hosted team collaboration platform with stable, feature-rich
cross-platform client apps. The UI is fast, good looking and intuitive, so very
little technical experience is needed for users of the platform. Rocket.Chat's
feature set is similar to Slack's, making it a good replacement for any team
looking to have greater control over their data.

bit more complex to use than some alternatives, and the UI is quite *retro*,
so may not be appropriate for a non-technical team.

of failure, and it's easy to self-host. However it's important to keep security

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> - Having many extensions installed raises entropy, causing your fingerprint to be more unique, hence making tracking easier.
- Much of the functionality of the above addons can be applied without installing anything, by configuring browser settings yourself. For Firefox this is done in the user.js
- Be careful when installing unfamiliar browser add-ons, since some can compromise your security and privacy. At the time of writing, the above list were all open source, verified and 'safe' extensions.
- In most situations, only a few of the above extensions will be needed in combination.
- See the [arkenfox wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions) for more information on the obsolescence and purposelessness of many popular extensions, and why you may only need a very limited set.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> - *A VPN does not make you anonymous - it merely changes your public IP address to that of your VPN provider, instead of your ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies / session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)*
- *Logging - If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider can see (and mess with) all your traffic. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this ([VPN leaks](https://vpnleaks.com/)). See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more*
- *IP Leaks - If configured incorrectly, your IP may be exposed through a DNS leak. This usually happens when your system is unknowingly accessing default DNS servers rather than the anonymous DNS servers assigned by an anonymity network or VPN. Read more: [What is a DNS leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html), [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com), [How to Fix a DNS Leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/how-to-fix-a-dns-leak.html)*
- *Stealth - It will be visible to your adversary that you are using a VPN (usually from the IP address), but other system and browser data, can still reveal information about you and your device (such as your local time-zone, indicating which region you are operating from)*
- *Many reviews are sponsored, and hence biased. Do your own research, or go with one of the above options*
- *Using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) (or another [Mix Network](/5_Privacy_Respecting_Software.md#mix-networks)) may be a better option for anonimity*

<summary>‚ú≥Ô∏è <b>Notable Mentions</b></summary>

> If you don't trust a VPN provider not to keep logs, then you could self-host your own VPN. This gives you you total control, but at the cost of anonymity (since your cloud provider, will require your billing info). See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand), to learn more, and get started with running a VPN. [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79) provides flexible, secure and easy Linux VMs, (from $0.007/hour or $5/month), Here is a [1-click install script](http://dovpn.carlfriess.com/)for on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79), by Carl Friess.
> Recently distributed self-hosted solutions for running your own VPNs have become more popular, with services like [Outline](https://getoutline.org/) letting you spin up your own instance and share it with friends and family. Since it's distributed, it is very resistant to blocking, and gives you world-wide access to the free and open internet. And since you have full control over the server, you can be confident that there is no logging or monitoring happening. However it comes at the cost of anonymity, especially if it's only you using your instance.</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Further Info</b></summary>

> *While choosing a VPN, consider the following: Logging policy (logs are bad),
Jurisdiction (avoid 5-eyes), Number of servers, availability and average load.
Payment method (anonymous methods such as BTC, Monero or cash are better),
Leak protection (1st-party DNS servers = good, and check if IPv6 is supported),
protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard = good). Finally, usability of their apps,
user reviews and download speeds.*

require much of a setup, and basically works straight out of the box, it supports a wide
range of systems (and can even run as a portable app on Windows). It allows you to do some
additional tasks, such as add local DNS addresses and zones with specific DNS records.
Compared to Pi-Hole, Technitium is very lightweight, but lacks the deep insights that
Pi-Hole provides, and has a significantly smaller community behind it.

### Mix Networks

- **[<img src='https://www.torproject.org/static/images/favicon/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Tor](https://www.torproject.org)** - Tor provides robust anonymity, allowing you to defend against surveillance, circumvent
censorship and reduce tracking. It blocks trackers, resists fingerprinting and implements

- **[<img src='https://geti2p.net/_static/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> I2P](https://geti2p.net)** - I2P offers great generic transports, it is well geared towards accessing hidden services,
and has a couple of technical benefits over Tor: P2P friendly with unidirectional short-lived
tunnels, it is packet-switched (instead of circuit-switched) with TCP and UDP, and continuously
profiles peers, in order to select the best performing ones.
I2P is less mature, but fully-distributed and self-organising, its smaller size means that it
hasn't yet been blocked or DOSed much.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> To provide low-latency browsing, Tor does not mix packets or generate cover traffic.
If an adversary is powerful enough, theoretically they could either observe the entire network,
or just the victims entry and exit nodes. It's worth mentioning, that even though your ISP
can not see what you are doing, they will be able determine that you are using a mix net,
to hide this - a VPN could be used as well.
If you are doing anything which could put you at risk, then good OpSec is essential,
as the authorities have traced criminals through the Tor network before,
and [made arrests](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/how-german-and-us-authorities-took-down-the-owners-of-darknet-drug-emporium-wall-street-market).
Don't let Tor provide you a false sense of security - be aware of information leaks through DNS, other programs or human error.
Tor-supported browsers may might lag behind their upstream forks, and include exploitable unpatched issues.
See [#19](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/issues/19)

Note: The Tor network is run by the community.
If you benefit from using it and would like to help sustain uncensored internet access for all,
consider [running a Tor relay](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide)

So a good and viable solution would be to use all of them, for different tasks.

### Proxies

A proxy acts as a gateway between you and the internet, it can be used to
act as a firewall or web filter, improves privacy and can also be used to
provide shared network connections and cache data to speed up common requests.
**Never use a [free](https://whatismyipaddress.com/free-proxies) proxy.**

> #### DNS Protocols

DNS-over-TLS was proposed in [RTC-7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)
by the IETF, then 2 years later, the DNS-over-HTTPS specification was outlined
in [RFC8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484) in October '18.
[DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), is a protocol that authenticates communications
between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing, through
using cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the
chosen DNS resolver, and haven't been tampered with. DNSCrypt is a well
battle-tested protocol, that has been in use since 2013, and is still widely used.

### Firewalls

A firewall is a program which monitors the incoming and outgoing traffic
on your network, and blocks requests based on rules set during its configuration.
Properly configured, a firewall can help protect against attempts to
remotely access your computer, as well as control which applications
can access which IPs.

> There are different [types](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-firewalls)
of firewalls, that are used in different circumstances.
This does not omit the need to configure your operating systems defences.
Follow these instructions to enable your firewall in
[Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off),
[Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642), [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)
and other [Linux distros](https://www.tecmint.com/start-stop-disable-enable-firewalld-iptables-firewall).

Even when properly configured, having a firewall enabled does not guarantee
bad network traffic can not get through and especially during boot if you
don't have root privileges.

### Ad Blockers

There are a few different ways to block ads - browser-based ad-blockers,
router-based / device blockers or VPN ad-blockers.
Typically they work by taking a maintained list of hosts,
and filtering each domain/ IP through it. Some also have other methods to
detect certain content based on pattern matching

- **[<img src='https://wp-cdn.pi-hole.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-Vortex-R-192x192.png' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/)** - Incredibly powerful, network-wide ad-blocker. Works out-of-the-box, light-weight with an intuitive
web interface, but still allows for a lot of advanced configuration for power users. As well as
blocking ads and trackers, Pi-Hole speeds up your network speeds quite significantly. The dashboard
has detailed statistics, and makes it easy to pause/ resume Pi-Hole if needed.

### Encrypted Cloud Storage

Backing up important files is essential, and keeping an off-site copy is recommended.
But many free providers do not respect your privacy, and are not secure enough for
sensitive documents.
Avoid free mainstream providers, such as Google Drive, cloud, Microsoft Overdrive, Dropbox.

It is recommended to encrypt files on your client machine, before syncing to the cloud.
[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org) is a cross-platform, open source encryption app, designed for just this.

## Utilities

### Virtual Machines

A virtual machine (VM) is a sandboxed operating system, running within your
current system. Useful for compartmentalisation and safely testing software,
or handling potentially malicious files

### Metadata Removal

[Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)/ [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)
is "data about data", this additional information attached to files can
lead us to
[share significantly more information than we intended](https://gizmodo.com/vice-magazine-just-accidentally-revealed-where-john-mca-5965295) to.

For example, if you upload an image of a sunset to the internet, but don't remove the metadata,
it [may reveal the location](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=1) (GPS lat + long)
of where it was taken, the device is was taken on, precise camera data, details about modifications and the
picture source + author. Social networks that remove metadata from your photos, often collect and store it,
for their own use.
This could obviously pose a security risk, and that is why it is recommended to strip out this data from a file before sharing.

- **[<img src='https://exifcleaner.com/images/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> ExifCleaner](https://exifcleaner.com)** - Cross-platform, open source, performant EXIF meta data removal tool. This GUI tool makes cleaning media files really

### Data Erasers

Simply deleting data, does
[not remove it](https://uk.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-is-my-personal-data-really-gone-when-its-deleted-from-a-device.html)
from the disk, and recovering deleted files is a
[simple task](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-recover-deleted-files-2622870).

Therefore, to protect your privacy, you should erase/ overwrite data from
the disk, before you destroy, sell or give away a hard drive.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> It is not recommended to root, or flash your device with a custom ROM if you are not an advanced user.
There are risks involved
- Although the above ROMs omit Google, they do open up other security issues: Without DM-verity on the system partition, the file system *could* be tampered with, and no verified boot stack, the kernel/initramfs also *could* be edited. You should understand the risks, before proceeding to flash a custom ROM to your device
- You will need to rely on updates from the community, which could be slower to be released - this may be an issue for a time-urgent, security-critical patch
- It is also possible to brick your device, through interrupted install or bad software
- Finally, rooting and flashing your device, will void your warranty

### Desktop Operating Systems

Windows and MacOS have many features that violate your privacy.
Microsoft and Apple are able to collect all your data (including, but not
limited to: keystrokes, searches and mic input, calendar data, music,
photos, credit card information and purchases, identity, passwords, contacts,
conversations and location data). Microsoft Windows is also more susceptible
to malware and viruses, than alternative systems.

Switching to Linux is a great choice in terms of security and privacy -
you don't need necessarily need to use a security distro, any well-maintained
stable distro is going to be considerably better than a proprietary OS

#### General Purpose Linux Distros
If you do not want to use a specalist security-based distro, or you are
new to Unix - then just switching to any well-maintained Linux distro,
is going to be significantly more secure and private than Windows or Mac OS.
Since it is open source, major distros are constantly being audited by
members of the community. Linux does not give users admin rights by default -
this makes is much less likely that your system could become infected with malware.
And of course, there is no proprietary Microsoft or Apple software constantly
monitoring everything you do.

Some good distros to consider would be: **[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)**,
**[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)**, or **[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)**-
all of which have a large community behind them. **[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)**
(based of Arch) is a good option, with a simple install process, used by new comers,
and expers alike.
**[POP_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)** and **[PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/)**
are reasonably new general purpose Linux, with a strong focus on privacy, but also
very user-friendly with an intuitive interfac and install process.
See [Detailed Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions).

#### BSD
BSD systems arguably have far superior network stacks.
**[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)** is designed for maximum security ‚Äî
not just with its features, but with its implementation practices.
It's a commonly used OS by banks and critical systems.
**[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)** is more popular, and aims for high
performance and ease of use.

#### Windows
Two alternative options for Windows users are Windows 10 AME (ameliorated)
project and the LTSC stream.
- **[Windows 10 AME](https://ameliorated.info/)** AME project aims at delivering
a stable, non-intrusive yet fully functional build of Windows 10 to anyone,
who requires the Windows operating system natively. Core applications, such
as the included Edge web-browser, Windows Media Player, Cortana, as well as
any appx applications (appx apps will no longer work), have also been successfully
eliminated. The total size of removed files is about 2 GB. Comes as a pre-built
ISO or option to build from scratch with de-bloat scripts. Strong, supportive
community on Telegram.
- **[Windows 10 LTSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/)**
LTSC provides several security benefits over a standard Win 10 Installation.
LTSC or Long Term Servicing Channel is a lightweight, low-cost Windows 10
version, that is intended for specialized systems, and receives less regular
feature updates. What makes it appealing, is that it doesn't come with any
bloatware or non-essential applications, and needs to be configured from the
ground up by the user. This gives you much better control over what is running
on your system, ultimately improving security and privacy. It also includes
several enterprise-grade
[security features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/whats-new-windows-10-2019#security),
which are not available in a standard Windows 10 instance. It does require
some technical knowledge to get started with, but once setup should perform
just as any other Windows 10 system. Note that you should only download the
LTSC ISO from the Microsoft's
[official page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) 


#### Improve the Security and Privacy of your current OS
After installing your new operating system, or if you have chosen to stick
with your current OS, there are a couple of things you can do to improve security.
See: [Windows 10 security guide](https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/windows-10-security-guide/privacy),
[Mac OS security guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/mac-privacy-tips/) or
[Linux security guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/linux-privacy-tips/).

of untrusted applications using Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. Written in C, virtually no dependencies, runs on any
modern Linux system, with no daemon running in the background, no complicated configuration, and it's super lightweight
and super secure, since all actions are implemented by the kernel. It includes security profiles for over 800 common
Linux applications. FireJail is recommended for running any app that may potential pose some kind of risk, such as
torrenting through Transmission, browsing the web, opening downloaded attachments.

> (The above software was last tested on 01/05/20).
Many of the above tools are not necessary or suitable for beginners,
and can cause your system to break - only use software that you need,
according to your threat model. Take care to only download from an
official/ legitimate source, verify the executable before proceeding,
and check reviews/ forums.
Create a system restore point, before making any significant changes to
your OS (such as disabling core features).

From a security and privacy perspective, Linux may be a better option.

> For Microsoft Windows, Windows Defender provides totally adequate virus
protection in most cases. These tools are intended for single-use in
detecting/ removing threats on an infected machine, and are not recommended
to be left running in the background, use portable editions where available.

Many anti virus products have a history of introducing vulnerabilities themselves,
and several of them seriously degrade the performance of your computer, as well as
decrease your privacy. Never use a free anti-virus, and never trust the companies
that offer free solutions, even if you pay for the premium package.
This includes (but not limited to) Avast, AVG, McAfee and Kasperky.
For AV to be effective, it needs intermate access to all areas of your PC,
so it is important to go with a trusted vendor, and monitor its activity closely.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> Not all cryptocurrencies are anonymous, and without using a privacy-focused coin,
a record of your transaction will live on a publicly available distributed ledger, forever.
If you send of receive multiple payments, ensure you switch up addresses or use a mixer,
to make it harder for anyone trying to trace your transactions.
Cryptocurrencies that allow private and public transactions may reveal meta
data about your transactions and balances when funds are moving from
private to public addresses which can compromise your privacy with methods
similar to a knapsack problem.

Always store private keys somewhere safe, but offline

Note: Cryptocurrency prices can go down. Storing any wealth in crypto may result in losses.
If you are new to digital currencies - do your research first, don't invest more than you can afford to loose,
and be very weary crypto-related scams are very common. as is and cryptocurrency-related malware.

<summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Further Info</b></summary>

> It is still possible to use currencies that have a public ledger 'privately',
but you will need to take great care not to cause any transactions to be
linked with your identity or activity. For example, avoid exchanges that
require KYC, and consider using a service such as
[Local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.net).
If you use a [Bitcoin ATM](https://coinatmradar.com), then take care to not
be physically tracked (CCTV, phone location, card payments etc)

Wasabi implements trustless CoinJoins over the Tor network. Neither an observer nor the participants can determine which output belongs to which input. This makes it difficult for outside parties to trace where a particular coin originated from and where it was sent to, which greatly improves privacy. Since it's trustless, the CoinJoin coordinator cannot breach the privacy of the participants. Wasabi is compatible with cold storage and hardware wallets, including OpenCard and Trezor.

- **[<img src='https://icon.horse/icon/electrum.org' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Electrum](https://electrum.org/)** - Long-standing Python-based Bitcoin wallet with good security features. Private keys are encrypted and do not touch the internet and balance is checked with a watch-only wallet. Compatible with other wallets, so there is no tie-in, and funds can be recovered with your secret seed. It supports proof-checking to verify transactions using SPV, multi-sig, and add-ons for compatibility with hardware wallets. A decentralized server indexes ledger transactions, meaning it's fast and doesn't require much disk space. The potential security issue here would not be with the wallet, but rather your PC - you must ensure your computer is secure and your wallet has a long, strong passphrase to encrypt it with.

### Virtual Credit Cards

Virtual cards generated provide an extra layer of security, improve privacy
and help protect from fraud. Most providers have additional features,
such as single-use cards (that cannot be charged more than once),
card limits (so you can be sure you won't be charged more than you expected)
and other security controls.

In most countries KYC is required. The bank will of course be able to see all your transactions.
Be sure to read their privacy policy and terms of service beforehand.
Not all services are available in all countries.

- **[<img src='https://icon.horse/icon/privacy.com' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Privacy.com](https://privacy.com)** - Privacy.com has a good reputation, and is the largest virtual card provider
in the US. Unlike other providers, it is free for personal use (up to 12 cards

<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> Note that credit card providers heavily track transaction metadata, which build
up a detailed picture of each persons spending habits. This is done both to
provide improved fraud alerts, but also because the data is extremely valuable
and is often 'anonymized' and sold to 3rd parties. Hence your privacy is degraded
if these cards are used for daily transactions


</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Further Info</b></summary>

> Paying for goods and services is a good example of where privacy and security conflict;
the most secure option would be to pay with credit card, since most providers include
comprehensive fraud protection, whereas the most private option would be to pay using
crypto currency or cash, since neither can be easily tied back to your identity.

### Social Networks

Over the past decade, social networks have revolutionized the way we communicate
and bought the world closer together - but it came at the
[cost of our privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services).

Social networks are built on the principle of sharing - but you, the user

<summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Further Info</b></summary>

> #### YouTube Proxies
The content on many of the smaller video sites, often just doesn't compare to YouTube.
So another alternative, is to access YouTube through a proxy client, which reduces what Google can track.
- Good options are: [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) (web), [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks) (web), [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) (Android), [YouTube++](https://iosninja.io/ipa-library/download-youtube-plus-ipa-ios) (iOS)
- Or download videos with [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) (cli) or [youtube-dl-gui](https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui) (gui). For just audio, there is [PodSync](https://podsync.net/)

#### Video Search Engines
[Petey Vid](https://www.peteyvid.com) is a non-biased video search engine.
Unlike normal search engines it indexes videos from a lot of sources,
including Twitter, Veoh, Instagram, Twitch, MetaCafe, Minds, BitChute,
Brighteon, D-Tube, PeerTube, and many others.

## Final Notes

### Conclusion

Many corporations put profit before people, collecting data and exploiting privacy. They claim to be secure but without being open source it can't be verified, until there's been a breach and it's too late. Switching to privacy-respecting open source software will drastically help improving your security, privacy and anonymity online.

However, that's not all you need to do. It is also important to: use strong and unique passwords, 2-factor authentication,
adopt good networking practices and be mindful of data that are collected when browsing the web. You can see the full
**[personal security checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/HEAD/CHECKLIST.md)** for more tips to stay safe. 


### Important Considerations

**Compartmentalise, Update and Be Ready**<br>
No piece of software is truly secure or private.  Further to this, software can only as secure as the system it is running on. Vulnerabilities are being discovered and patched all the time, so you much keep your system up-to-date. Breaches occur regularly, so compartmentalise your data to minimise damage. It's not just about choosing secure software, you must also follow good security practices.

**Attack Surface**<br>
It is a good idea to keep your trusted software base small, to reduce potential attack surface. At the same time trusting a single application for too many tasks or too much personal data could be a weakness in your system. So you will need to judge the situation according to your threat model, and carefully plan which software and applications you trust with each segment of your data.

**Convenience Vs Security**<br>
There is often a trade-off between convenience and security. Construct a threat model, and choose a balance that is right for you. In a similar way in some situations there is privacy and security conflict (e.g. Find My Phone is great for security, but terrible for privacy, and anonymous payments may be good for privacy but less secure than insured fiat currency). Again it is about assessing your situation, understanding the risks and making an informed decision.

**Hosted Vs Self-Hosted Considerations**<br>
When using a hosted or managed application that is open-source software - there is often no easy way to tell if the version running is the same as that of the published source code (even published signatures can be faked). There is always the possibility that additional backdoors may have been knowingly or unknowingly implemented in the running instance. One way round this is to self-host software yourself. When self-hosting you will then know for sure which code is running, however you will also be responsible for the managing security of the server, and so may not be recommended for beginners.

**Open Source Software Considerations**<br>
Open source software has long had a reputation of being more secure than its closed source counterparts. Since bugs are raised transparently, fixed quickly, the code can be checked by experts in the community and there is usually little or no data collection or analytics. 
That being said, there is no piece of software that it totally bug free, and hence never truly secure or private. Being open source, is in no way a guarantee that something is safe. There is no shortage of poorly-written, obsolete or sometimes harmful open source projects on the internet. Some open source apps, or a dependency bundled within it are just plain malicious (such as, that time [Colourama was found in the PyPI Repository](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/31/when-good-software-goes-bad-malware-in-open-source/))

**Proprietary Software Considerations**<br>
When using a hosted or proprietary solution - always check the privacy policy, research the reputation of the organisation, and be weary about which data you trust them with. It may be best to choose open source software for security-critical situations, where possible.

**Maintenance**<br>
When selecting a new application, ensure it is still being regularly maintained, as this will allow for recently discovered security issues to be addressed. Software in an alpha or beta phase, may be buggy and lacking in features, but  more importantly - it could have critical vulnerabilities open to exploit. Similarly, applications that are no longer being actively maintained may pose a security risk, due to lack of patching. When using a forked application, or software that is based on an upstream code base, be aware that it may receive security-critical patches and updates at a slightly later date than the original application. 

**This List: Disclaimer**<br>
This list contains packages that range from entry-level to advanced, a lot of the software here will not be appropriate for all audiences. It is in no way a definitive list of secure applications, and aims only to be a guide, a collection of software and services that myself and other contributors have used, and would recommend. There will always be new vulnerabilities discovered or introduced, bugs and security-critical glitches, malicious actors and poorly configured systems. It is up to you to do your research, draw up a threat model, and decide where and how your data are managed.

If you find something on this list that should no longer be deemed secure or private/ or should have a warning note attached, please raise an issue. In the same way if you know of something that is missing, or would like to make an edit, then pull requests are welcome, and are much appreciated!
