## Intro [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Large data-hungry corporations dominate the digital world but with little, or no respect for your privacy.
Migrating to open-source applications with a strong emphasis on security will help stop
corporations, governments, and hackers from logging, storing or selling your personal data.

**Note**: Remember that [no software is perfect](#disclaimer), and it is important to follow good [security practices](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/master/README.md#contents).

A Codeberg mirror is available [here](https://codeberg.org/alicia/awesome-privacy).

## Password Managers

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)**  | Fully-featured, open source password manager with cloud-sync. Bitwarden is easy-to-use with a clean UI and client apps for desktop, web and mobile. See also [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), a self-hosted, Rust implementation of the Bitwarden server and compatible with [upstream Bitwarden clients](https://bitwarden.com/download/).
**[KeePass](https://keepass.info)** | Hardened, secure and offline password manager. Does not have cloud-sync baked in, deemed to be [gold standard](https://keepass.info/ratings.html) for secure password managers. KeePass clients: [Strongbox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strongbox-keepass-pwsafe/id897283731) *(Mac & iOS)*, [KeePassDX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kunzisoft.keepass.free) *(Android)*, [KeeWeb](https://keeweb.info) *(Web-based/ self-hosted)*, [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) *(Windows, Mac & Linux)*, see more KeePass clients and extensions at [awesome-keepass](https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass) by @lgg. 
**[LessPass](https://lesspass.com)** *(Self-Hosted)* | LessPass is a little different, since it generates your passwords using a hash of the website name, your username and a single main-passphrase that you reuse. It omits the need for you to ever need to store or sync your passwords. They have apps for all the common platforms and a CLI, but you can also self-host it.
**[Padloc](https://padloc.app)** | A modern, open source password manager for individuals and teams. Beautiful, intuitive and dead simple to use. Apps available for all platforms and you can self-host it as well.

#### Notable Mentions

**[Password Safe](https://www.pwsafe.org/)** is an offline, open source password manager designed by [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/), with native applications for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS, and support for YubiKey. The UI is a little dated, and there is no official browser extension, making is slightly less convenient to use compared with other options

**[PassBolt](https://www.passbolt.com/)** is a good option for teams. It is free, open source, self-hosted, extensible and OpenPGP based. It is specifically good for development and DevOps useage, with integrations for the terminal, browser and chat, and can be easily extended for custom usage, and deployed quickly with Docker

**[1Password](https://1password.com)** (proprietary) is a fully-featured cross-platform password manager with sync. Free for self-hosted data (or $3/ month hosted). Be aware that 1Password is not fully open source, but they do regularly publish results of their independent [security audits](https://support.1password.com/security-assessments), and they have a solid reputation for transparently disclosing and fixing vulnerabilities

**Other Open Source PM**: [Buttercup](https://buttercup.pw), [Clipperz](https://clipperz.is), [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org), [Padloc](https://padloc.app), [TeamPass](https://teampass.net), [PSONO](https://psono.com), [UPM](http://upm.sourceforge.net), [Gorilla](https://github.com/zdia/gorilla/wiki), [Seahorse](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/seahorse) (for GNOME), [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring), [KDE Wallet Manager](https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_Wallet_Manager).

## File Encryption

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr)** | VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use it to either encrypt a specific file or directory, or an entire disk or partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehensive encryption options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable edition. VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now deprecated) TrueCrypt.
**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org)** | Open source client-side encryption for cloud files - Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use, but has fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works on Windows, Linux and Mac - but also has excellent mobile apps.
**[age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)** | `age` is a simple, modern and secure CLI file encryption tool and Go library. It features small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability


#### Notable Mentions
[AES Crypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/) is a light-weight and easy file encryption utility. It includes applications for Windows, Mac OS, BSD and Linux, all of which can be interacted with either through the GUI, CLI or programatically though an API (available for Java, C, C# and Python). Although it is well established, with an overall positive reputation, there have been some [security issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/b7riov/aes_crypt_security_audit_1_serious_issue_found/) raised recently.

[CryptSetup](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup) is a convenient layer for use on top of [dm-crypt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt). [EncFS](https://www.arg0.net/encfs) is a cross-platform file-based encryption module, for use within user local directories. [geli](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=geli&sektion=8) is a disk encryption subsystem included with FreeBSD.

PGP may be useful for encrypting individual files and folders, preparing files for transmission, or adding an additional layer of security to sensitive 
data. With PGP, you can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify files and folders: see [PGP Tools](#pgp-managers)

[BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) is popular among Microsoft Windows and enterprise users, and provides fast, efficient and (if correctly configured) reasonably secure full drive encryption. However it is not open source, has poor compatibility with other operating systems, and has some very dodgy [defaults](https://www.diskcryptor.org/why-not-bitlocker/), which could lead to your system being compromised. Similarly, Apple's [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) on MacOS is easy and secure, but again, the source code is proprietary.

[DiskCryptor](https://www.diskcryptor.org/) is a Windows-only, open source, file and volume encryption solution, that makes a good alternative to BitLocker.

If you need to create a compressed archive, then [PeaZip](https://www.peazip.org/) is a great little cross-platform open source file archiver utility. It allows you to create, open, and extract RAR TAR ZIP archives. It also has a [password-protection feature](https://peazip.github.io/peazip-password.html), which encrypts compressed files using AES-256, which is also compatible with most other archive utilities

#### Word of Warning
Where possible, choose a cross-platform and well established encryption method, so that you are never faced with not being able to access your files using your current system.

Although well-established encryption methods are usually very secure, if the password is not strong, then an adversary may be able to gain access to your files, with a powerful enough GPU. If your system is compromised, then the password may also be able to be skimmed with a keylogger or other similar malware, so take care to follow good basic security practices

## Browsers

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)** | LibreWolf is an independent fork of Firefox that aims to provide better default settings to improve on privacy, security and user freedom. Mozilla telemetry is disabled, ties with Google (Safe Browsing) are severed, the content blocker [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) is included and privacy defaults are guided by research like the [Arkenfox project](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/). 
**[Brave Browser](https://brave.com)** | Brave Browser, currently one of the most popular private browsers - it provides speed, security, and privacy by blocking trackers with a clean, yet fully-featured UI. It also pays you in [BAT tokens](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) for using it. Brave also has Tor built-in, when you open up a private tab/ window.
**[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)** | Significantly more private, and offers some nifty privacy features than Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. After installing, there are a couple of small tweaks you will need to make, in order to secure Firefox. For a though config, see [@arkenfox's user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/). You can also follow one of these guides by: [Restore Privacy](https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/) or [12Bytes](https://12bytes.org/7750)
**[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)** | Tor provides an extra layer of anonymity, by encrypting each of your requests, then routing it through several nodes, making it near-impossible for you to be tracked by your ISP/ provider. It does make every-day browsing a little slower, and some sites may not work correctly. As with everything there are [trade-offs](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/issues/19)
**[Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/)** | Hardened and privacy-respecting fork of Chromium for Android. Comes with built-in adblock and additional settings for hardening.

#### Notable Mentions
Mobile Browsers: [Mull](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) Hardened fork of FF-Fenix (Android), [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) (Android/ iOS), [DuckDuckGo Browser](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/mobile/ios/) (Android/ iOS), [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/) + [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android) (Android), [Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/) (iOS)

Additional Desktop: [Nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/), [WaterFox](https://www.waterfox.net), [Epic Privacy Browser](https://www.epicbrowser.com), [PaleMoon](https://www.palemoon.org), [Iridium](https://iridiumbrowser.de/), [Sea Monkey](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/), [Ungoogled-Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium), [Basilisk Browser](https://www.basilisk-browser.org/) and [IceCat](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/)

12Bytes also maintains a list privacy & security [extensions](https://12bytes.org/articles/tech/firefox/firefox-extensions-my-picks/)

#### Word of Warning
New vulnerabilities are being discovered and patched all the time - use a browser that is being actively maintained, in order to receive these security-critical updates.

Even privacy-respecting browsers, often do not have the best privacy options enabled by default. After installing, check the privacy & security settings, and update the configuration to something that you are comfortable with. 12Bytes maintains a comprehensive guide on [Firefox Configuration for Privacy and Performance](https://12bytes.org/articles/tech/firefox/firefoxgecko-configuration-guide-for-privacy-and-performance-buffs/)

**See also** [Browser & Search Security Checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/master/README.md#browser-and-search) and recommended [Browser Extensions](#browser-extensions) for privacy & security.

## Search Engines

Google frequently modifies and manipulates search, and is in pursuit of eliminating competition and promoting their own services above others. They also track, collect, use and sell detailed user search and meta data.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)** | DuckDuckGo is a very user-friendly, fast and secure search engine. It's totally private, with no trackers, cookies or ads. It's also highly customisable, with dark-mode, many languages and features. They even have a [.onion](https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion) URL, for use with Tor and a [no Javascript version](https://duckduckgo.com/html/)
**[Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/)** | French service that aggregates Bings results, with its own results. Qwant doesn't plant any cookies, nor have any trackers or third-party advertising. It returns non-biased search results, with no promotions. Qwant has a unique, but nice UI.
**[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)** | Dutch search engine that searches on google and shows the results (slightly rearranged). It has several configurations that improve privacy during use (it is not open source)

#### Notable Mentions
[MetaGear](https://metager.org), [YaCy](https://yacy.net), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/). 

[Searx](https://searx.github.io/searx/) and [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) are two self-hostable search engines that use the results of multiple other engines (such as Google and Bing) at the same time. They're open source and self-hostable, although using a [public instance](https://searx.space) has the benefit of not singling out your queries to the engines used.

12Bytes also maintains a list of [privacy-respecting search engines](https://12bytes.org/articles/tech/alternative-search-engines-that-respect-your-privacy/)

## Encrypted Messaging

Without using a secure app for instant messaging, all your conversations, meta data and more are unprotected. Signal is one of the best options - it's easy, yet also highly secure and privacy-centric.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Signal](https://signal.org/)** | Probably one of the most popular, secure private messaging apps that combines strong encryption (see [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol)) with a simple UI and plenty of features. It's widely used across the world, and easy-to-use, functioning similar to WhatsApp - with instant messaging, read-receipts, support for media attachments and allows for high-quality voice and video calls. It's cross-platform, open-source and totally free. Signal is [recommended](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152) by Edward Snowden, and is a perfect solution for most users
**[Session](https://getsession.org)** | Session is a fork of Signal, however unlike Signal it does not require a mobile number (or any other personal data) to register, instead each user is identified by a public key. It is also decentralized, with servers being run by the community though [Loki Net](https://loki.network), messages are encrypted and routed through several of these nodes. All communications are E2E encrypted, and there is no meta data.
**[XMPP](https://xmpp.org/)** | XMPP, also known as Jabber, is an open standard for decentralized messaging that has been widely used for decades. It has actually been the basis upon which WhatsApp, Facebook's Chat and Google's Talk were built, but these companies (eventually) chose to remove the interoperability with other servers. Prominent XMPP clients support [OMEMO end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMEMO), which is based on the [Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm) that is used in Signal. For more hands-on information and to register an account you can visit [JoinJabber](https://joinjabber.org). Below you can find a list of OMEMO-enabled clients for all the major platforms.<br><br><table><thead><tr><th>Program</th><th>Linux</th><th>MacOS</th><th>Windows</th><th>Android</th><th>iOS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://gajim.org">Gajim</a> (<a href="https://gajim.org/download/#install-instructions">OMEMO plugin</a>)</td><td>‚úì</td><td><a href="https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/-/wikis/help/Gajim-on-macOS">~</a></td><td>‚úì</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dino.im">Dino</a> ‚úÜ</td><td>‚úì</td><td></td><td><a href="https://github.com/LAGonauta/dino/releases">‚úì</a></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://conversations.im">Conversations</a> / <a href="https://blabber.im">Blabber</a> ‚úÜ</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>‚úì</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://monal-im.org">Monal IM</a></td><td></td><td>‚úì</td><td></td><td></td><td>‚úì</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://beagle.im">Beagle IM</a> / <a href="https://siskin.im">Siskin IM</a> ‚úÜ</td><td></td><td>‚úì</td><td></td><td></td><td>‚úì</td></tr></tbody></table>
**[Matrix](https://matrix.org)** | Matrix is a decentralized open network for secure communications, with E2E encryption with Olm and Megolm. Along with the [Element](https://element.io/) client, it supports VOIP + video calling and IM + group chats. Since Matrix has an open specification and Simple pragmatic RESTful HTTP/JSON API it makes it easy to integrates with existing 3rd party IDs to authenticate and discover users, as well as to build apps on top of it.

#### Other Notable Mentions
Other private, encrypted and open source messaging apps include: [Surespot](https://www.surespot.me), [Chat Secure](https://chatsecure.org/) (iOS only) and [Status](https://status.im/). Note that [Tor Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tor-messenger)s been removed from the list, since development has halted.

[KeyBase](keybase.io/inv/6d7deedbc1) allows encrypted real-time chat, group chats, and public and private file sharing. It also has some nice features around cryptographically proving social identities, and makes PGP signing, encrypting and decrypting messages easy. However, since it was [acquired by Zoom](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom) in 2020, it has no longer been receiving regular updates.

[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) can be used over existing chat networks (such as email or message boards). It provides cryptographic privacy and authentication, PGP is used to encrypt messages.<br>
**Note/ Issues with PGP**  PGP is [not easy](https://restoreprivacy.com/let-pgp-die/) to use for beginners, and could lead to human error/ mistakes being made, which would be overall much worse than if an alternate, simpler system was used. Do not use [32-bit key IDs](https://evil32.com/) - they are too short to be secure. There have also been vulnerabilities found in the OpenPGP and S/MIME, defined in [EFAIL](https://efail.de/), so although it still considered secure for general purpose use, for general chat, it may be better to use an encrypted messaging or email app instead.

#### Word of Warning
Many messaging apps claim to be secure, but if they are not open source, then this cannot be verified - and they **should not be trusted**. This applies to [Telegram](https://telegram.org), [Threema](https://threema.ch), [Cypher](https://www.goldenfrog.com/cyphr), [Wickr](https://wickr.com/), [Silent Phone](https://www.silentcircle.com/products-and-solutions/silent-phone/) and [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), to name a few - these apps should not be used to communicate any sensitive data. [Wire](https://wire.com/) has also been removed, due to a [recent acquisition](https://blog.privacytools.io/delisting-wire/)


## P2P Messaging

With [Peer-to-Peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) networks, there are no central server, so there is nothing that can be raided, shut-down or forced to turn over data. There are P2P networks available that are open source, E2E encrypted, routed through Tor services, totally anonymous and operate without the collection of metadata.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Session](https://getsession.org)** + **[LokiNet](https://loki.network)** client | Loki is an open source set of tools that allow users to transact and communicate anonymously and privately, through a decentralised, encrypted, onion-based network. Session is a desktop and mobile app that uses these private routing protocols to secure messages, media and metadata.
**[Briar](https://briarproject.org)** | Tor-based Android app for P2P encrypted messaging and forums. Where content is stored securely on your device (not in the cloud). It also allows you to connect directly with nearby contacts, without internet access (using Bluetooth or WiFi).
**[Ricochet Refresh](https://www.ricochetrefresh.net)** | Desktop instant messenger, that uses the Tor network to rendezvous with your contacts without revealing your identity, location/ IP or meta data. There are no servers to monitor, censor, or hack so Ricochet is secure, automatic and easy to use.
**[Jami](https://jami.net)** | P2P encrypted chat network with cross-platform GNU client apps. Jami supports audio and video calls, screen sharing, conference hosting and instant messaging.
**[Tox](https://tox.chat)** + **[qTox](https://qtox.github.io)** client | Open source, encrypted, distributed chat network, with clients for desktop and mobile - see [supported clients](https://tox.chat/clients.html). Clearly documented code and multiple language bindings make it easy for developers to integrate with Tox.

#### Other Notable Mentions
[Cwtch](https://cwtch.im), [BitMessage](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage), [RetroShare](https://retroshare.cc), [Tor Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/sunsetting-tor-messenger) *(deprecated)*, [TorChat2](https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat) *(deprecated)*, [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im) *(deprecated)*


## Encrypted Email

Email is not secure - your messages can be easily intercepted and read. Corporations scan the content of your mail, to build up a profile of you, either to show you targeted ads or to sell onto third-parties. Through the [Prism Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)), the government also has full access to your emails (if not end-to-end encrypted) - this applies to Gmail, Outlook Mail, Yahoo Mail, GMX, ZoHo, iCloud, AOL and more.

The below email providers are private, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) and reasonably secure. This should be used in conjunction with [good email practices](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/master/README.md#emails)

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)** | An open-source, end-to-end encrypted anonymous email service. ProtonMail has a modern easy-to-use and customizable UI, as well as fast, secure native mobile apps. ProtonMail has all the features that you'd expect from a modern email service and is based on simplicity without sacrificing security. It has a free plan or a premium option for using custom domains (starting at $5/month). ProtonMail requires no personally identifiable information for signup, they have a [.onion](https://protonirockerxow.onion) server, for access via Tor, and they accept anonymous payment: BTC and cash (as well as the normal credit card and PayPal).
**[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)** | Free and open source email service based in Germany. It has a basic intuitive UI, secure native mobile apps, anonymous signup, and a .onion site. Tutonota has a full-featured free plan or a premium subscription for businesses allowing for custom domains ($12/ month).<br>Tutanota [does not use OpenPGP](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/differences-email-encryption/) like most encrypted mail providers, instead they use a standardized, hybrid method consisting of a symmetrical and an asymmetrical algorithm (with 128 bit AES, and 2048 bit RSA). This causes compatibility issues when communicating with contacts using PGP. But it does allow them to encrypt much more of the header data (body, attachments, subject lines, and sender names etc) which PGP mail providers cannot do
**[Mailfence](https://mailfence.com?src=digitald)** | Mailfence supports OpenPGP so that you can manually exchange encryption keys independently from the Mailfence servers, putting you in full control. Mailfence has a simple UI, similar to that of Outlook, and it comes with bundled with calendar, address book, and files. All mail settings are highly customizable, yet still clear and easy to use. Sign up is not anonymous, since your name, and prior email address is required. There is a fully-featured free plan, or you can pay for premium, and use a custom domain ($2.50/ month, or $7.50/ month for 5 domains), where Bitcoin, LiteCoin or credit card is accepted
**[MailBox.org](https://mailbox.org/)** | A Berlin-based, eco-friendly secure mail provider. There is no free plan, the standard service costs ‚Ç¨12/year. You can use your own domain, with the option of a [catch-all alias](https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/Using+catch-all+alias+with+own+domain). They provide good account security and email encryption, with OpenPGP, as well as encrypted storage. There is no dedicated app, but it works well with any standard mail client with SSL. There's also currently no anonymous payment option
**[Skiff](https://skiff.com/)** | End-to-end encrypted, open-source, and privacy-first email that also integrates Web3 features such as crypto wallets and decentralized storage. Skiff has a simple and intuitive UI, supports [mobile apps](https://skiff.com/download) on iOS and Android, and requires no personally identifiable information to sign up or create an account. Skiff offers a Pro plan with additional storage space, aliases, custom domains, and more for $8 per month that can be paid using a credit card or with a crypto wallet.

#### Other Notable Mentions
[HushMail](https://www.hushmail.com/tapfiliate/?tap_a=44784-d2adc0&tap_s=724845-260ce4&program=hushmail-for-small-business), [Soverin](https://soverin.net), [StartMail](https://www.startmail.com), [Posteo](https://posteo.de), [Lavabit](https://lavabit.com).

### Word of Warning
- When using an end-to-end encryption technology like OpenPGP, some metadata in the email header will not be encrypted.
- OpenPGP also does not support Forward secrecy, which means if either your or the recipient's private key is ever stolen, all previous messages encrypted with it will be exposed. You should take great care to keep your private keys safe.

### Self-Hosted Email
If you do not want to trust an email provider with your messages, you can host your own mail server. Without experience, this can be notoriously hard to correctly configure, especially when it comes to security. You may also find that cost, performance and features make it a less attractive option. If you do decide to go down this route, [Mail-in-a-box](https://mailinabox.email/), is an easy to deploy, open source mail server. It aims to promote decentralization, innovation, and privacy on the web, as well as have automated, auditable, and idempotent system configuration. Other ready-to-go self-hosted mail options include [Mailu](https://mailu.io/1.7/) and [Mail Cow](https://mailcow.email/), both of which are docker containers.

## Email Clients
Email clients are the programs used to interact with the mail server. For hosted email, then the web and mobile clients provided by your email service are usually adequate, and may be the most secure option. For self-hosted email, you will need to install and configure mail clients for web, desktop or mobile. A benefit of using an IMAP client, is that you will always have an offline backup of all email messages (which can then be encrypted and archived), and many applications let you aggregate multiple mailboxes for convenience. Desktop mail clients are not vulnerable to the common browser attacks, that their web app counterparts are.

#### Word of Warning
One disadvantage of mail clients, is that many of them do not support 2FA, so it is important to keep your device secured and encrypted

## Anonymous Mail Forwarding

Revealing your real email address online can put you at risk. Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and still land in your primary inbox. This protects your real email address from being revealed. Aliases are generated automatically, the first time they are used. This approach lets you identify which provider leaked your email address, and block an alias with 1-click.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Anonaddy](https://anonaddy.com)** | An open source anonymous email forwarding service, allowing you to create unlimited email aliases. Has a free plan.

## Team Collaboration Platforms

Now more than ever we are relying on software to help with team collaboration. Unfortunately many popular options, such as [Slack](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/slack-privacy-settings-notifications), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/microsoft-teams-meeting-data-privacy), [Google for Work](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tracks-you-privacy/) and [Discord](https://cybernews.com/privacy/discord-privacy-tips-that-you-should-use-in-2020/) all come with some serious privacy implications.

Typical features of team collaboration software includes: instant messaging, closed and open group messaging, voice and video conference calling, file sharing/ file drop, and some level or scheduling functionality.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat)** | Easy-to-deploy, self-hosted team collaboration platform with stable, feature-rich cross-platform client apps. The UI is fast, good looking and intuitive, so very little technical experience is needed for users of the platform.

Fast intuitive group and 1-to-1 chats with text and rich media using decentralized chat rooms, with a mail feature for delivering messages to offline contacts. A channels feature makes it possible for members of different teams to stay up-to-date with each other, and to share files. Also includes built-in forums, link aggregations, file sharing and voice and video calling. RetroShare is a bit more complex to use than some alternatives, and the UI is quite *retro*, so may not be appropriate for a non-technical team
**[Element](https://element.io/)** | Privacy-focused messenger using the Matrix protocol. The Element client allows for group chat rooms, media sharing voice and video group calls.
**Internet Relay Chat** | An IRC-based solution is another option, being decentralized there is no point of failure, and it's easy to self-host. However it's important to keep security in mind while configuring your IRC instance and ensure that channels are properly encrypted - IRC tends to be better for open communications. There's a [variety of clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) to choose from - popular options include: [The Longe](https://thelounge.chat/) (Web-based), [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) (Linux), [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/help/protocols/irc/) (Linux), [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) (Linux, terminal-based), [IceChat](https://www.icechat.net/) (Windows), [XChat Aqua](https://xchataqua.github.io/) (MacOS), [Palaver](https://palaverapp.com/) (iOS) and [Revolution](https://github.com/MCMrARM/revolution-irc) (Android)

**[Dialog](https://dlg.im/en/)** | A corporate secure collaborative messenger. A clean UI and all the basic features, including groups, file sharing, audio/ video calls, searching and chat bots

### Notable Mentions
Some chat platforms allow for cross-platform group chats, voice and video conferencing, but without the additional collaboration features. For example, [Tox](https://tox.chat/), [Session](https://getsession.org/), [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im/), [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) and [Jami](https://jami.net/).

Netcraft also has a handy online tool: [Site Report](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/) for checking what any given website is running. **Download**: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netcraft-anti-phishing-ex/bmejphbfclcpmpohkggcjeibfilpamia) \ [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/netcraft-toolbar?src=external-apps-hero) \ [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/netcraft-anti-phishing-extension/) \ [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/netcraft-extension/ngjhgbnmdjjnmejmpamalgnlnmopllkm)

#### Notable Mention
[Extension source viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/crxviewer) is a handy extension for viewing the source code of another browser extension, which is a useful tool for verifying the code does what it says 

#### Word of Warning
- _Having many extensions installed raises entropy, causing your fingerprint to be more unique, hence making tracking easier._
- _Much of the functionality of the above addons can be applied without installing anything, by configuring browser settings yourself. For Firefox this is done in the user.js_
- _Be careful when installing unfamiliar browser add-ons, since some can compromise your security and privacy. At the time of writing, the above list were all open source, verified and 'safe' extensions._
- _In most situations, only a few of the above extensions will be needed in combination._
- _See the [arkenfox wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions) for more information on the obsolescence and purposelessness of many popular extensions, and why you may only need a very limited set._

## Virtual Private Networks

VPNs are good for getting round censorship, increasing protection on public WiFi, obscuring your IP address, and reducing what data your ISP can log. But for the best anonymity, you should use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). VPNs do not mean you are magically protected, or anonymous (see below). 

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Mullvad](http://mullvad.net/en/)** | Mullvad is one of the best for privacy, they have a totally anonymous sign up process, you don't need to provide any details at all, you can choose to pay anonymously too (with Monero, BTC or cash)
**[Azire](https://www.azirevpn.com/)** |  Azire is a Swedish VPN provider, who owns their own hardware with physically removed storage and a no logging policy. Pricing starts at ‚Ç¨3.25/mo, with crypto (including XMR) supported. Note that they've not yet been audited, and client applications are not open source, for more info, see [#140](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/issues/140).
**[IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/)** | Independently Security Audited VPN with anonymous signup, no logs, no cloud or customer data stored, open-source apps and website. Strong ethics: no trackers, no false promises, no surveillance ads. Accepts various payment methods including crypotcurrencies. 
**[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)** | From the creators of ProtonMail, ProtonVPN has a solid reputation. They have a full suite of user-friendly native mobile and desktop apps. ProtonVPN is one of the few "trustworthy" providers that also offer a free plan
**[OVPN](https://www.ovpn.com/)** | A court-proven VPN service with support for Wireguard and OpenVPN support, and optional ad-blocking. Running on dedicated hardware, with no hard drives

#### Word of Warning
- *A VPN does not make you anonymous - it merely changes your public IP address to that of your VPN provider, instead of your ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies/ session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)*
- *Logging - If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider can see (and mess with) all your traffic. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this ([VPN leaks](https://vpnleaks.com/)). See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more*
- *IP Leaks - If configured incorrectly, your IP may be exposed through a DNS leak. This usually happens when your system is unknowingly accessing default DNS servers rather than the anonymous DNS servers assigned by an anonymity network or VPN. Read more: [What is a DNS leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html), [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com), [How to Fix a DNS Leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/how-to-fix-a-dns-leak.html)*
- *Stealth - It will be visible to your adversary that you are using a VPN (usually from the IP address), but other system and browser data, can still reveal information about you and your device (such as your local time-zone, indicating which region you are operating from)*
- *Many reviews are sponsored, and hence biased. Do your own research, or go with one of the above options*
- *Using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) (or another [Mix Network](/5_Privacy_Respecting_Software.md#mix-networks)) may be a better option for anonimity*

#### Considerations
*While choosing a VPN, consider the following: Logging policy (logs are bad), Jurisdiction (avoid 5-eyes), Number of servers, availability and average load. Payment method (anonymous methods such as BTC, Monero or cash are better), Leak protection (1st-party DNS servers = good, and check if IPv6 is supported), protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard = good). Finally, usability of their apps, user reviews and download speeds.*

#### Self-Hosted VPN
If you don't trust a VPN provider not to keep logs, then you could self-host your own VPN. This gives you you total control, but at the cost of anonymity (since your cloud provider, will require your billing info). See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand), to learn more, and get started with running a VPN.
[Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79) provides flexible, secure and easy Linux VMs, (from $0.007/hour or $5/month), this guide explains how to set up VPN on: [CentOS 7](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-centos-7) or [Ubuntu 18.4+](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-centos-7). See more about configuring [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/digital-ocean-quick-start-guide/) or [IKEv2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-ikev2-vpn-server-with-strongswan-on-ubuntu-18-04-2). Alternatively, here is a [1-click install script](http://dovpn.carlfriess.com/)for  on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79), by Carl Friess.

Recently distributed self-hosted solutions for running your own VPNs have become more popular, with services like [Outline](https://getoutline.org/) letting you spin up your own instance and share it with friends and family. Since it's distributed, it is very resistant to blocking, and gives you world-wide access to the free and open internet. And since you have full control over the server, you can be confident that there is no logging or monitoring happening. However it comes at the cost of anonymity, especially if it's only you using your instance.

## Self-Hosted Network Security

Fun little projects that you can run on a Raspberry Pi, or other low-powered computer. In order to help detect and prevent threats, monitor network and filter content

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net)** | Network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole. Pi-Hole can significantly speed up your internet, remove ads and block malware. It comes with a nice web interface and a mobile app with monitoring features, it's open source, easy to install and very widely used
**[Technitium](https://technitium.com/dns/)** | Another DNS server for blocking privacy-invasive content at it's source. Technitium doesn't require much of a setup, and basically works straight out of the box, it supports a wide range of systems (and can even run as a portable app on Windows). It allows you to do some additional tasks, such as add local DNS addresses and zones with specific DNS records. Compared to Pi-Hole, Technitium is very lightweight, but lacks the deep insights that Pi-Hole provides, and has a significantly smaller community behind it
**[IPFire](https://www.ipfire.org)** | A hardened, versatile, state-of-the-art open source firewall based on Linux. Its ease of use, high performance and extensibility make it usable for everyone
**[PiVPN](https://pivpn.io)** | A simple way to set up a home VPN on a any Debian server. Supports OpenVPN and WireGuard with elliptic curve encryption keys up to 512 bit. Supports multiple DNS providers and custom DNS providers - works nicely along-side PiHole
**[E2guardian](http://e2guardian.org)** | Powerful open source web content filter
**[SquidGuard](http://www.squidguard.org)** | A URL redirector software, which can be used for content control of websites users can access. It is written as a plug-in for Squid and uses blacklists to define sites for which access is redirected
**[PF Sense](https://www.pfsense.org)** | Widely used, open source firewall/router
**[Zeek](https://www.zeek.org)** |  Detect if you have a malware-infected computer on your network, and powerful network analysis framework and monitor
**[Firezone](https://github.com/firezone/firezone)** | Open-source self-hosted VPN and firewall built on WireGuard¬Æ.

## Mix Networks
[Mix networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network) are routing protocols, that create hard-to-trace communications, by encrypting and routing traffic through a series of nodes. They help keep you anonymous online, and unlike VPNs -there are no logs

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Tor](https://www.torproject.org)** | Tor provides robust anonymity, allowing you to defend against surveillance, circumvent censorship and reduce tracking. It blocks trackers, resists fingerprinting and implements multi-layered encryption by default, meaning you can browse freely. Tor also allows access to OnionLand: hidden services
**[I2P](https://geti2p.net)** | I2P offers great generic transports, it is well geared towards accessing hidden services, and has a couple of technical benefits over Tor: P2P friendly with unidirectional short-lived tunnels, it is packet-switched (instead of circuit-switched) with TCP and UDP, and continuously profiles peers, in order to select the best performing ones. <br>I2P is less mature, but fully-distributed and self-organising, its smaller size means that it hasn't yet been blocked or DOSed much
**[Freenet](https://freenetproject.org)** | Freenet is easy to setup, provides excellent friend To Friend Sharing vs I2P, and is great for publishing content anonymously. It's quite large in size, and very slow so not the best choice for casual browsing

Tor, I2P and Freenet are all anonymity networks - but they work very differently and each is good for specific purposes. So a good and viable solution would be to use all of them, for different tasks.
*You can read more about how I2P compares to Tor, [here](https://blokt.com/guides/what-is-i2p-vs-tor-browser)*

#### Notable Mentions
See also: [GNUnet](https://gnunet.org/en/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [ZeroNet](https://zeronet.io/), [Panoramix](https://panoramix-project.eu), and [Nym](https://nymtech.neteu)

#### Word of Warning
To provide low-latency browsing, Tor does not mix packets or generate cover traffic. If an adversary is powerful enough, theoretically they could either observe the entire network, or just the victims entry and exit nodes. It's worth mentioning, that even though your ISP can not see what you are doing, they will be able determine that you are using a mix net, to hide this - a VPN could be used as well. If you are doing anything which could put you at risk, then good OpSec is essential, as the authorities have traced criminals through the Tor network before, and [made arrests](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/how-german-and-us-authorities-took-down-the-owners-of-darknet-drug-emporium-wall-street-market). Don't let Tor provide you a false sense of security - be aware of information leaks through DNS, other programs or human error. Tor-supported browsers may might lag behind their upstream forks, and include exploitable unpatched issues. See [#19](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/issues/19)

Note: The Tor network is run by the community. If you benefit from using it and would like to help sustain uncensored internet access for all, consider [running a Tor relay](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide)


## Proxies
A proxy acts as a gateway between you and the internet, it can be used to act as a firewall or web filter, improves privacy and can also be used to provide shared network connections and cache data to speed up common requests. Never use a [free](https://whatismyipaddress.com/free-proxies) proxy.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[ShadowSocks](https://shadowsocks.org)** | Secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. Open source, superfast, cross-platform and easy to deploy, see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shadowsocks)
**[Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org)** | Non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk

#### Notable Mentions
[V2ray-core](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core) is a platform for building proxies to bypass network restrictions and protect your privacy. See [more](https://github.com/hugetiny/awesome-vpn)

#### Word of Warning
[Malicious Proxies](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-edward_zaborowski-doppelganger.pdf) are all too common. Always use open source software, host it yourself or pay for a reputable cloud service. Never use a free proxy; it can monitor your connection, steal cookies and contain malware. VPNs are a better option, better still - use the Tor network.


## DNS
Without using a secure, privacy-centric DNS all your web requests can be seen in the clear. You should configure your DNS queries to be managed by a service that respects privacy and supports DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1)** | One of the most performant options, Cloudflare's DNS supports DoH and DoT, and has a Tor implementation, providing world-class protection. They have native cross-platform apps, for easy set-up.
**[AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html)** | Open-source DNS provider, specialising in the blocking of ads, trackers and malicious domains. They have been independently audited and do not keep logs
**[NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)** | An ad-blocking, privacy-protecting, censorship-bypassing DNS. Also comes with analytics, and the ability to shield kids from adult content

See also this [Full List of Public DoH Servers](https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS), you can then check the performance of your chosen server with [DNSPerf](https://www.dnsperf.com/). Awesome Self-Hosted also has a [good list](https://awesome.tilde.fun/d/23-list-of-dns-servers
). To read more about choosing secure DNS servers, see [this article](https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-security-and-privacy-choosing-the-right-provider-61fc6d54b986), and [this article](https://geekwire.co.uk/privacy-and-security-focused-dns-resolver/).

#### Notable Mentions
- [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net) is a well-funded, performant DNS with a strong focus on privacy and security and easy set-up, however questions have been raised about the motivation of some of the financial backers.
- [BlahDNS](https://blahdns.com) (Japan, Finland or Germany) is an excellent security-focused DNS
- [OpenNIC](https://www.opennic.org/), [NixNet DNS](https://nixnet.services/dns) and [UncensoredDNS](https://blog.uncensoreddns.org) are open source and democratic, privacy-focused DNS
- [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver, designed to be fast and lean. Incorporates modern features and based on open standards
- [Clean Browsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/), is a good option for protecting kids,  they offer comprehensive DNS-based Content Filtering
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/) Mullvads public DNS with QNAME minimization and basic ad blocking. It has been audited by the security experts at Assured. You can use this privacy-enhancing service even if you don‚Äôt use Mullvad.

#### Word of Warning
Using an encrypted DNS resolver will not make you anonymous, it just makes it harder for third-partied to discover your domain history. If you are using a VPN, take a [DNS leak test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/), to ensure that some requests are not being exposed.

#### DNS Protocols
DNS-over-TLS was proposed in [RTC-7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858) by the IETF, then 2 years later, the DNS-over-HTTPS specification was outlined in [RFC8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484) in October '18. [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing, through using cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver, and haven‚Äôt been tampered with. DNSCrypt is a well battle-tested protocol, that has been in use since 2013, and is still widely used.

## DNS Clients

| Provider | Description |

## Firewalls
A firewall is a program which monitors the incoming and outgoing traffic on your network, and blocks requests based on rules set during its configuration. Properly configured, a firewall can help protect against attempts to remotely access your computer, as well as control which applications can access which IPs.

#### Word of Warning
There are different [types](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-firewalls) of firewalls, that are used in different circumstances. This does not omit the need to configure your operating systems defences. Follow these instructions to enable your firewall in [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off), [Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642), [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) and other [Linux distros](https://www.tecmint.com/start-stop-disable-enable-firewalld-iptables-firewall).
Even when properly configured, having a firewall enabled does not guarantee bad network traffic can not get through and especially during boot if you don't have root privileges.

## Ad Blockers


There are a few different ways to block ads - browser-based ad-blockers, router-based / device blockers or VPN ad-blockers. Typically they work by taking a maintained list of hosts, and filtering each domain/ IP through it. Some also have other methods to detect certain content based on pattern matching

| Provider | Description |

For hosted solutions - use a strong password, keep your credentials safe and enable 2FA.

## Encrypted Cloud Storage

Backing up important files is essential, and keeping an off-site copy is recommended. But many free providers do not respect your privacy, and are not secure enough for sensitive documents. Avoid free mainstream providers, such as Google Drive, cloud, Microsoft Overdrive, Dropbox.

It is recommended to encrypt files on your client machine, before syncing to the cloud. [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org) is a cross-platform, open source encryption app, designed for just this.

#### Notable Mentions
An alternative option, is to use a cloud computing provider, and implement the syncing functionality yourself, and encrypt data locally before uploading it - this may work out cheaper in some situations. You could also run a local server that you physically own at a secondary location, that would mitigate the need to trust a third party cloud provider. Note that some knowledge in securing networks is required.

**[OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/)** | An open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size, via Tor servers. OnionShare does require installing (compatible with Windows, Mac OS and Linux), but the benefit is that your files are transferred directly to the recipient, without needing to be hosted on an interim server. The host needs to remain connected for the duration of the transfer, but once it is complete, the process will be terminated. Source code: [repo](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare)

#### Notable Suggestions
[Instant.io](https://github.com/webtorrent/instant.io), is another peer-to-peer based solution, using [Web Torrent](https://webtorrent.io). For specifically transferring images, [Up1](https://github.com/Upload/Up1) is a good self-hosted option, with client-side encryption. Finally [PsiTransfer](https://github.com/psi-4ward/psitransfer) is a feature-rich, self-hosted file drop, using streams.

## Browser Sync

It is not advised to sign into your browser, since it allows for more of your browsing data to be exposed, and can tie anonymous identities to your real account.

#### Word of Warning
Strip out unneeded GET parameters if they reveal any device or referrer information, so as to not inadvertently allow a website to link your devices. [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls) may help with this.


## Video Conference Calls

With the [many, many security issues with Zoom](https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/news/zoom-security-privacy-woes), and other mainstream options, it becomes clear that a better, more private and secure alternative is required. As with other categories, the "best video calling app" will be different for each of us, depending on the ratio of performance + features to security + privacy required in your situation.

## Metadata Removal Tools

[Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)/ [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) is "data about data", this additional information attached to files can lead us to [share significantly more information than we intended](https://gizmodo.com/vice-magazine-just-accidentally-revealed-where-john-mca-5965295) to. 
For example, if you upload an image of a sunset to the internet, but don't remove the metadata, it [may reveal the location](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=1) (GPS lat + long) of where it was taken, the device is was taken on, precise camera data, details about modifications and the picture source + author. Social networks that remove metadata from your photos, often collect and store it, for their own use. This could obviously pose a security risk, and that is why it is recommended to strip out this data from a file before sharing.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[ExifCleaner](https://exifcleaner.com)** | Cross-platform, open source, performant EXIF meta data removal tool. This GUI tool makes cleaning media files really easy, and has great batch process support. Created by @szTheory, and uses [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org)
**[ExifTool](https://exiftool.org)** (CLI) | Platform-independent open source Perl library & CLI app, for reading, writing and editing meta data. Built by Phill Harvey. Very good performance, and supports all common metadata formats (including  EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, AFCP and ID3). An official [GUI application](https://exiftool.org/gui/) is available for Windows, implemented by Bogdan Hrastnik.
**[ImageOptim](https://github.com/ImageOptim/ImageOptim)** (MacOS) | Native MacOS app, with drag 'n drop image optimization and meta data removal

#### Notable Mentions
It's possible (but slower) to do this without a third-party tool. For Windows, right click on a file, and go to: `Properties --> Details --> Remove Properties --> Remove from this File --> Select All --> OK`.

Alternatively, with [ImageMagic](https://imagemagick.org) installed, just run `convert -strip path/to/image.png` to remove all metadata. If you have [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) installed, then just go to `File --> Export As --> Export --> Advanced Options --> Uncheck the "Save EXIF data" option`.

Often you need to perform meta data removal programmatically, as part of a script or automation process.  
GoLang: [go-exif](https://github.com/dsoprea/go-exif) by @dsoprea | JS: [exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr) by @MikeKovarik | Python: [Piexif](https://github.com/hMatoba/Piexif) by @hMatoba | Ruby: [Exif](https://github.com/tonytonyjan/exif) by @tonytonyjan | PHP: [Pel](https://github.com/pel/pel) by @mgeisler.


## Data Erasers
Simply deleting data, does [not remove it](https://uk.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-is-my-personal-data-really-gone-when-its-deleted-from-a-device.html) from the disk, and recovering deleted files is a [simple task](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-recover-deleted-files-2622870). Therefore, to protect your privacy, you should erase/ overwrite data from the disk, before you destroy, sell or give away a hard drive.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Eraser](https://eraser.heidi.ie)** (Windows) |  Allows you to completely remove sensitive data from your hard drive by overwriting it several times with carefully selected patterns
**[Hard Disk Scrubber](http://www.summitcn.com/hdscrub.html)** (Windows) | Easy to use, but with some advanced features, including custom wipe patterns. Data Sanitation Methods:  AFSSI-5020, DoD 5220.22-M, and Random Data
**[SDelete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete)** (Windows) | Microsoft Secure Delete is a CLI utility, uses DoD 5220.22-M
**[OW Shredder](https://schiffer.tech/ow-shredder.html)** (Windows) | File, folder and drive portable eraser for Windows. Bundled with other tools to scan, analyze, and wipe, and other traces that were left behind. Includes context menu item, recycle bin integration
**[DBAN](https://dban.org)** (bootable) | Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot disk that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction. DBAN is the free edition of [Blanco](https://www.blancco.com/products/drive-eraser/), which is an enterprise tool designed for legal compliance.
**[nwipe](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe)** (Cross-platform) | C-based secure light-weight disk eraser, operated through the easy-to-use CLI or a GUI interface
**[shred](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html)** (Unix) | A CLI utility that can be used to securely delete files and devices, to make them extremely difficult to recover. See also, [wipe](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wipe) for erasing files from magnetic media
**[Secure Remove](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-srm/)** (Unix) | CLI utility for securely removing files, directories and whole disks, works on Linux, BSD and MacOS
**[Mr. Phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com)** (Android/ iOS) | Proprietary, closed-source suite of forensic data tools for mobile. The data eraser allows for both Android and iOS to be fully wiped, through connecting them to a PC.

#### Notable Mentions
There's no need to use a third-party tool. You can boot into a UNIX-based system, mount the disk you need to erase, and use a command to write it with arbitrary data. For best results, this process should be repeated several times. This is a good way to wipe a disk, before selling or destroying it, to protect your data.

Such as the [`dd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29) command, is a tool to convert and copy files, but running `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M` will quickly overwrite the whole disk with zeros. Or [badblocks](https://linux.die.net/man/8/badblocks) which is intended to search for all bad blocks, but can also be used to write zeros to a disk, by running `sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdd`. An effective method of erasing an SSD, it to use [hdparm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdparm) to issue a [secure erase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security) command, to your target storage device, for this, see step-by-step instructions via: [wiki.kernel.org](https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase). Finally, `[srm](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-srm/)` can be use to securely remove files or directories, just run `srm -zsv /path/to/file` for a single pass over.

**[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app)** | Open source, feature rich, powerful type 2 hypervisor for Mac, can emulate x86-64 OSes on Apple Silicon Macs

#### Notable Mentions

[QEMU](https://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) is a virtual hardware emulation tool, meaning it is less appropriate for creating fully independant sandboxes, but performance is considerable better than that of a traditional virtual machine.

[VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) is popular in the enterprise world, it is not open source, and although there is a free version, a license is required to access all features. VMWare performs very well when running on a server, with hundreds of hosts and users. For Mac users, [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/uk/) is a popular option which performs really well, but again is not open source. For Windows users, there's [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v), which is a native Windows product, developed by Microsoft.

## Social Networks

Over the past decade, social networks have revolutionized the way we communicate and bought the world closer together - but it came at the [cost of our privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services). Social networks are built on the principle of sharing - but you, the user should be able to choose with whom you share what, and that is what the following sites aim to do.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Aether](https://getaether.net)** | Self-governing communities with auditable moderation - a similar concept to Reddit, but more privacy-sensitive, democratic and transparent. Aether is open source and peer-to-peer, it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux
**[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)** | A 100% open source and self-hostable discussion platform you can use as a mailing list, discussion forum or long-form chat room.

**[Minds](https://www.minds.com/register?referrer=as93)** | A social media site, which aims to bring people together and support open conversations. Get paid for creating content
**[Vero](https://vero.co/)** | (closed-source) A mobile-based social network, whose USP is that they have "No Ads. No Data Mining. No Algorithms." Since Vero is not open source, it is not possible to verify the validity of these claims

#### Other Notable Mentions
- [diaspora\*](https://diasporafoundation.org), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), [Friendica](https://friendi.ca) and [Hubzilla ](https://hubzilla.org) - distributed, decentralized social networks, built on open protocols
- [Tildes](https://tildes.net), [Lemmy](https://dev.lemmy.ml) and [notabug.io](https://notabug.io) - bulletin boards and news aggregators (similar to Reddit)
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) - A free, ethical, federated photo sharing platform (FOSS alternative to Instagram)

#### Main-stream networks
The content on many of these smaller sites tends to be more *niche*. To continue using Twitter, there are a couple of [tweaks](https://www.offensiveprivacy.com/blog/twitter-privacy), that will improve security. For Reddit, use a privacy-respecting client - such as [Reditr](http://reditr.com/). Other main-stream social networking sites do not respect your privacy, so should be avoided, but if you choose to keep using them see [this guide](https://proprivacy.com/guides/social-media-privacy-guide) for tips on protecting your privacy


## Video Platforms

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org)** | Free and open-source federated video platform that uses peer-to-peer technology to reduce load on individual servers when viewing videos. You can [self-host](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#/install-any-os), or [find an instance](https://joinpeertube.org/instances#instances-list), and then watch videos from any PeerTube server

**[BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/)** | A video hosting platform, that was founded in 2017 to allow uploaders to avoid content rules enforced on other platforms, such as YouTube

#### Word of Warning
Without moderation, some of these platforms accommodate video creators whose content may not be appropriate for all audiences

#### YouTube Proxies
The content on many of the smaller video sites, often just doesn't compare to YouTube. So another alternative, is to access YouTube through a proxy client, which reduces what Google can track.
- Good options are: [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) (web), [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks) (web), [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) (Android), [YouTube++](https://iosninja.io/ipa-library/download-youtube-plus-ipa-ios) (iOS)

#### Word of Warning
News reader apps don't have a good [reputation](https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/apps/privacy-risks-news-apps) when it comes to protecting users privacy, and often display biased content. Many have revenue models based on making recommendations, with the aim of trying to get you to click on sponsored articles - and for that a lot of data needs to have been collected about you, your habits, interests and routines. 


## Proxy Sites

These are websites that enable you to access existing social media platforms, without using their primary website - with the aim of improving privacy & security and providing better user experience. The below options are open source (so can be self-hosted, if you wish), and they do not display ads or tracking (unless otherwise stated).

| Provider | Description |

**[Libreddit](https://libreddit.spike.codes/)** (Reddit) |  Private front-end for Reddit written in Rust. Massively [faster than Reddit](https://github.com/spikecodes/libreddit#speed) by not including ads, trackers or bloat. Libreddit can be deployed and selfhosted through `cargo`, Docker and Repl.it and proxies all requests through the back-end. Libreddit currently implements most of Reddit's functionalities that don't require users to be signed in.
**[WebProxy](https://weboproxy.com/)** | Free proxy service, with Tor mode (which is recommended to enable). Designed to be used to evade censorship and access geo-blocked content. The service is maintained by [DevroLabs](https://devrolabs.com/), who also run the [OnionSite](https://onionsite.weboproxy.com/) web proxy, they claim to that all traffic is 256-bit SSL-encrypted, but this cannot be verified - never enter any potentially personally identifiable information, and use it purely for consuming content.

**[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org)** | One of the most private cryptocurrencies, since no meta data is available (not even the transaction amount). It uses complex on-chain cryptographic methods such as Ring signatures, RingCT, Kovri, and Stealth addresses all of which help protect the privacy of users
**[ZCash](https://z.cash)** | Uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect privacy cryptographic technique, that allows two users to transact without ever revealing their true identity or address. The Zcash blockchain uses two types of addresses and transactions, Z transactions and addresses are private and T transactions and addresses are transparent like Bitcoin.

It is still possible to use currencies that have a public ledger 'privately', but you will need to take great care not to cause any transactions to be linked with your identity or activity. For example, avoid exchanges that require KYC, and consider using a service such as [Local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.net). If you use a [Bitcoin ATM](https://coinatmradar.com), then take care to not be physically tracked (CCTV, phone location, card payments etc)

#### Notable Mentions
Other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies include: [PIVX](https://pivx.org), [Bitcoin Private](https://btcprivate.org), [Verge](https://vergecurrency.com), and [Piratechain](https://pirate.black/). 

#### Word of Warning
Not all cryptocurrencies are anonymous, and without using a privacy-focused coin, a record of your transaction will live on a publicly available distributed ledger, forever. If you send of receive multiple payments, ensure you switch up addresses or use a mixer, to make it harder for anyone trying to trace your transactions. Cryptocurrencies that allow private and public transactions may reveal meta data about your transactions and balances when funds are moving from private to public addresses which can compromise your privacy with methods similar to a knapsack problem. Store private keys somewhere safe, but offline and preferably cold.

Note: Cryptocurrency prices can go down. Storing any wealth in crypto may result in losses. If you are new to digital currencies - do your research first, don't invest more than you can afford, and be very weary of scams and cryptocurrency-related malware. 

## Crypto Wallets

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Wasabi Wallet](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/)** (Bitcoin) | An open source, native desktop wallet for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Wasabi implements trustless CoinJoins over the Tor network. Neither an observer nor the participants can determine which output belongs to which input. This makes it difficult for outside parties to trace where a particular coin originated from and where it was sent to, which greatly improves privacy. Since it's trustless, the CoinJoin coordinator cannot breach the privacy of the participants. Wasabi is compatible with cold storage, and hardware wallets, including OpenCard and Trezor.
**[Trezor](https://trezor.io/)**<br>(All Coins) | Open source, cross-platform, offline, crypto wallet, compatible with 1000+ coins. Your private key is generated on the device, and never leaves it, all transactions are signed by the Trezor, which ensures your wallet is safe from theft. There are native apps for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS, but Trezor is also compatible with other wallets, such as Wasabi. You can back the Trezor up, either by writing down the seed, or by duplicating it to another device. It is simple and intuitive to use, but also incredible customisable with a large range of advanced features.
**[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/)** (Bitcoin) | An easy-to-use, super secure Bitcoin hardware wallet, which can be used independently as an air-gapped wallet. ColdCard is based on partially signed Bitcoin transactions following the [BIP174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/main/bip-0174.mediawiki) standard. Built specifically for Bitcoin, and with a variety of unique security features, ColdCard is secure, trustless, private and easy-to-use. Companion products for the ColdCard include: [BlockClock](http://blockclockmini.com/), [SeedPlate](http://bitcoinseedbackup.com/) and [ColdPower](http://usbcoldpower.com/)
**[Electrum](https://electrum.org/)** (Bitcoin) | Long-standing Python-based Bitcoin wallet with good security features. Private keys are encrypted and do not touch the internet and balance is checked with a watch-only wallet. Compatible with other wallets, so there is no tie-in, and funds can be recovered with your secret seed. It supports proof-checking to verify transactions using SPV, multi-sig  and add-ons for compatibility with hardware wallets. A decentralized server indexes ledger transactions, meaning it's fast and doesn't require much disk space. The potential security issue here would not be with the wallet, but rather your PC - you must ensure your computer is secure and your wallet has a long, strong passphrase to encrypt it with.
**[Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/)** (Bitcoin) | An open-source, Bitcoin-only privacy-focused wallet, with some innovative features.<br>Samourai Wallet works under any network conditions, with a full offline mode, useful for cold storage.

**[Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/)** (Bitcoin) | Sparrow is a Bitcoin wallet for those who value financial self sovereignty. Sparrow‚Äôs emphasis is on security, privacy and usability. Sparrow does not hide information from you - on the contrary it attempts to provide as much detail as possible about your transactions and UTXOs, but in a way that is manageable and usable.                
**[Atomic Wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/)** (All Coins) | Atomic is an open source desktop and mobile based wallet, where you're private keys are stored on your local device, and do not touch the internet. Atomic has great  feature sets, and supports swapping, staking and lending directly from the app. However, most of Atomic's features require an active internet connection, and Atomic [does not support](https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/160-does-atomic-wallet-offer-hardware-wallet-integration) hardware wallets yet. Therefor, it may only be a good choice as a secondary wallet, for storing small amounts of your actively used currency
**[CryptoSteel](https://cryptosteel.com/how-it-works)**<br>(All Coins) | A steel plate, with engraved letters which can be permanently screwed - CryptoSteel is a good fire-proof, shock-proof, water-proof and stainless cryptocurrency backup solution.
**[BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/)** (Bitcoin or Ethereum & ERC-20 tokens) | Open source hardware wallet, supporting secure multisig with the option for making encrypted backups on a MicroSD card.
**[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/)** (Bitcoin) | Secure, open source Bitcoin cold storage wallet, with the option for making encrypted backups on a MicroSD card.

#### Word of Warning
Avoid using any online/ hot-wallet, as you will have no control over the security of your private keys. Offline paper wallets are very secure, but ensure you store it properly - to keep it safe from theft, loss or damage.

### Notable Mentions
[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (Ethereum and ERC20 tokens) is a bridge that allows you to visit and interact with distributed web apps in your browser. Metamask has good hardware wallet support, so you can use it to swap, stake, sign, lend and interact with dapps without you're private key ever leaving your device. However the very nature of being a browser-based app means that you need to stay vigilant with what services you give access to.

## Crypto Exchanges

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Bisq](https://bisq.network)** | An open-source, peer-to-peer application that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for national currencies. Fully decentralized, and no registration required.
**[LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)** | Person-to-person exchange, find people local to your area, and trade directly with them, to avoid going through any central organisation.

[BitMex](https://www.bitmex.com/) has more advanced trading features, but ID verification is required for higher value trades involving Fiat currency. For buying and selling alt-coins, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=X2BHKID1) has a wide range of currencies, and ID verification is not needed for small-value trades.


## Virtual Credit Cards

Virtual cards generated provide an extra layer of security, improve privacy and help protect from fraud. Most providers have additional features, such as single-use cards (that cannot be charged more than once), card limits (so you can be sure you won't be charged more than you expected) and other security controls.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/join/VW7WC)** | Privacy.com has a good reputation, and is the largest virtual card provider in the US. Unlike other providers, it is free for personal use (up to 12 cards per month) with no fees, apps and support is good. There is a premium is plan for $10/month, with 1% cashback 36 cards/ month
**[Revolut Premium](https://revolut.ngih.net/Q9jdx)** | Revolut is more of a digital bank account, and identity checks are required to sign up. Virtual cards only availible on Premium/ Metal accounts, which start at $7/month.
**[MySudo](https://mysudo.com)** | Much more than just virtual cards, MySudo is a platform for creating compartmentalised identities, each with their own virtual cards, virtual phone numbers, virtual email addresses, messaging, private browsing and more. There is a free plan for up to 3 identities, and premium plans start at $0.99/ month
**[Blur](https://dnt.abine.com/#feature/payments)** | Blur by Abine has virtual card functinality, 

*[PayLasso](https://www.paylasso.com), [JoinToken](https://jointoken.com), [EntroPay](https://www.entropay.com) are now discontinued*


## Other Payment Methods

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**Cash** | Actual physical cash is still the most private option, with no chance of leaving any transactional records
**Gift Cards** | Gift cards can be purchased for cash in many convenience stores, and redeemed online for goods or services. Try to avoid CCTV as best as possible.
**Pre-paid Cards** | Similarly to gift cards, buying a pre-paid card for cash, can enable you to purchase goods and services in stores that only accept card payments.

Paying for goods and services is a good example of where privacy and security conflict; the most secure option would be to pay with credit card, since most providers include comprehensive fraud protection, whereas the most private option would be to pay using crypto currency or cash, since neither can be easily tied back to your identity.

#### Word of Warning
Note that credit card providers heavily track transaction metadata, which build up a detailed picture of each persons spending habits. This is done both to provide improved fraud alerts, but also because the data is extremely valuable and is often 'anonymized' and sold to 3rd parties. Hence your privacy is degraded if these cards are used for daily transactions


## Budgeting Tools

## Mobile Operating Systems

If you are an Android user, your device has Google built-in at its core. [Google tracks you](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/08/21/google-data-collection-research/),
collecting a wealth of information, and logging your every move. A [custom ROM](https://www.xda-developers.com/what-is-custom-rom-android/), is an open source, usually Google-free mobile OS that can be [flashed](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-custom-rom-android/) to your device.

| Provider | Description |

#### Other Notable Mentions
[Replicant OS](https://www.replicant.us/) is a fully-featured distro, with an emphasis on freedom, privacy and security. [OmniRom](https://www.omnirom.org/), [Resurrection Remix OS](https://resurrectionremix.com/), and [Paranoid Android](http://paranoidandroid.co/) are also popular options. Alternatively, [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com/) is a Linux (Ubuntu)- based OS. It is secure by design and runs on almost any device, - but it does fall short when it comes to the app store.

To install apps on the Play Store without using the Play Store app see [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore). For Google Play Service see [MicroG](https://microg.org/)


#### Word of Warning
It is not recommended to root, or flash your device with a custom ROM if you are not an advanced user. There are risks involved
- Although the above ROMs omit Google, they do open up other security issues: Without DM-verity on the system partition, the file system *could* be tampered with, and no verified boot stack, the kernel/initramfs also *could* be edited. You should understand the risks, before proceeding to flash a custom ROM to your device
- You will need to rely on updates from the community, which could be slower to be released - this may be an issue for a time-urgent, security-critical patch
- It is also possible to brick your device, through interrupted install or bad software
- Finally, rooting and flashing your device, will void your warranty


## Desktop Operating Systems

Windows 10 has many features that violate your privacy. Microsoft and Apple are able to collect all your data (including, but not limited to: keystrokes, searches and mic input, calendar data, music, photos, credit card information and purchases, identity, passwords, contacts, conversations and location data). Microsoft Windows is also more susceptible to malware and viruses, than alternative systems.

Switching to Linux is a great choice in terms of security and privacy - you don't need necessarily need to use a security distro, any well-maintained stable distro is going to be considerably better than a proprietary OS

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)** (containerized apps) | Open-source security-oriented operating system for single-user desktop computing. It uses virtualisation, to run each application in its own compartment to avoid data being leaked. It features [Split GPG](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/), [U2F Proxy](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/u2f-proxy/), and [Whonix integration](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/whonix/).

It comes bundled with other features too: Keystroke Anonymization, Time Attack Defences, Stream Isolation, Kernel Self Protection Settings and an Advanced Firewall. Open source, well audited, and with a strong community - Whonix is based on Debian, [KickSecure](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure) and [Tor](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_and_Tor)
**[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)** (live) | Tails is a live operating system (so you boot into it from a USB, instead of installing). It preserves your privacy and anonymity through having no persistent memory/ leaving no trace on the computer. Tails has Tor built-in system-wide, and uses state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging. Open source, and built on top of Debian. Tails is simple to stop, configure and use
**[Parrot](https://parrotlinux.org/)** (security)| Parrot Linux, is a full Debian-based operating system, that is geared towards security, privacy and development. It is fully-featured yet light-weight, very open. There are 3 editions: General Purpose, Security and Forensic. The Secure distribution includes its own sandbox system obtained with the combination of [Firejail](https://firejail.wordpress.com/) and [AppArmor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor) with custom security profiles. While the Forensics Edition is bundled with a comprehensive suite of security/ pen-testing tools, similar to Kali and Black Arch
**[Discreete Linux](https://www.privacy-cd.org/)** (offline)| Aimed at journalists, activists and whistle-blowers, Discreete Linux is similar to Tails, in that it is booted live from external media, and leaves no/ minimal trace on the system.

**[Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)** | Alpine is a security-oriented, lightweight distro based on musl libc and busybox. It compiles all user-space binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection. Install and setup may be quite complex for some new users

#### Notable Mentions
[Septor](https://septor.sourceforge.io/) is a Debian-based distro with the KDE Plasma desktop environment, and Tor baked-in. Designed for surfing the web anonymously, and completing other internet-based activities (with Thunderbird, Ricochet IM, HexChat, QuiteRSS, OnionShare).

Subgraph is still in beta (at the time of writing), but still is well tested, and has some nice anonymization features

For defensive security, see [Kali](https://www.kali.org) and [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org), both are bundled with hundreds of security tools, ready for pretty much any job.  

Other security-focused distros include: [TENS OS](https://www.tens.af.mil/), [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/coreos?stream=stable), [Kodachi](https://www.digi77.com/linux-kodachi/) and [IprediaOS](https://www.ipredia.org). (Avoid systems that are not being actively maintained)


#### General Purpose Linux Distros
If you do not want to use a specalist security-based distro, or you are new to Unix - then just switching to any well-maintained Linux distro, is going to be significantly more secure and private than Windows or Mac OS.
Since it is open source, major distros are constantly being audited by members of the community. Linux does not give users admin rights by default - this makes is much less likely that your system could become infected with malware. And of course, there is no proprietary Microsoft or Apple software constantly monitoring everything you do.

Some good distros to consider would be: **[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)**, **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)**, or **[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)**- all of which have a large community behind them. **[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)** (based of Arch) is a good option, with a simple install process, used by new comers, and expers alike.  **[POP_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)** and **[PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/)** are reasonably new general purpose Linux, with a strong focus on privacy, but also very user-friendly with an intuitive interfac and install process. See [Simple Comparison](https://computefreely.org/) or [Detailed Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions).

#### BSD
BSD systems arguably have far superior network stacks. **[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)** is designed for maximum security ‚Äî not just with its features, but with its implementation practices. It‚Äôs a commonly used OS by banks and critical systems. **[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)** is more popular, and aims for high performance and ease of use.

#### Windows
Two alternative options for Windows users are Windows 10 AME (ameliorated) project and the LTSC stream.
**[Windows 10 AME](https://ameliorated.info/)** AME project aims at delivering a stable, non-intrusive yet fully functional build of Windows 10 to anyone, who requires the Windows operating system natively. Core applications, such as the included Edge web-browser, Windows Media Player, Cortana, as well as any appx applications (appx apps will no longer work), have also been successfully eliminated. The total size of removed files is about 2 GB. Comes as a pre-built ISO or option to build from scratch with de-bloat scripts. Strong, supportive community on Telegram.
**[Windows 10 LTSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/)** LTSC provides several security benefits over a standard Win 10 Installation. LTSC or Long Term Servicing Channel is a lightweight, low-cost Windows 10 version, that is intended for specialized systems, and receives less regular feature updates. What makes it appealing, is that it doesn't come with any bloatware or non-essential applications, and needs to be configured from the ground up by the user. This gives you much better control over what is running on your system, ultimately improving security and privacy. It also includes several enterprise-grade [security features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/whats-new-windows-10-2019#security), which are not available in a standard Windows 10 instance. It does require some technical knowledge to get started with, but once setup should perform just as any other Windows 10 system. Note that you should only download the LTSC ISO from the Microsoft's [official page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) 


#### Improve the Security and Privacy of your current OS
After installing your new operating system, or if you have chosen to stick with your current OS, there are a couple of things you can do to improve security. See: [Windows 10 security guide](https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/windows-10-security-guide/privacy), [Mac OS security guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/mac-privacy-tips/) or [Linux security guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/linux-privacy-tips/).

#### Word of Warning
(The above software was last tested on 01/05/20). Many of the above tools are not necessary or suitable for beginners, and can cause your system to break - only use software that you need, according to your threat model. Take care to only download from an official/ legitimate source, verify the executable before proceeding, and check reviews/ forums. Create a system restore point, before making any significant changes to your OS (such as disabling core features). From a security and privacy perspective, Linux may be a better option.

## Anti-Malware

Cross-platform, open source malware detection and virus prevention tools

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net)** | An open source  cross-platform antivirus engine for detecting viruses, malware & other malicious threats. It is versatile, performant and very effective
**[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)** | Web-based malware scanner, that inspects files and URLs with over 70 antivirus scanners, URL/domain services, and other tools to extract signals and determine the legitimacy
**[Armadito](https://www.armadito.com)** | Open source signature-based anti-virus and malware detection for Windows and Linux. Supports both ClamAV signatures and YARA rules. Has a user-friendly interface, and includes a web-based admin panel for remote access.

#### Notable Mentions
For 1-off malware scans on Windows, [MalwareBytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com) is portable and very effective, but [not open source](https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/5495-open-source)

#### Word of Warning
For Microsoft Windows, Windows Defender provides totally adequate virus protection in most cases. These tools are intended for single-use in detecting/ removing threats on an infected machine, and are not recommended to be left running in the background, use portable editions where available.

Many anti virus products have a history of introducing vulnerabilities themselves, and several of them seriously degrade the performance of your computer, as well as decrease your privacy. Never use a free anti-virus, and never trust the companies that offer free solutions, even if you pay for the premium package. This includes (but not limited to) Avast, AVG, McAfee and Kasperky. For AV to be effective, it needs intermate access to all areas of your PC, so it is important to go with a trusted vendor, and monitor its activity closely.

## Home Automation

If you have smart devices within your home, you should consider running the automation locally, rather than using a cloud service. This will reduce the amount of exploits you could potentially be vulnerable to. It is also important to have network monitoring and firewalls enabled, to ensure suspicious activity is flagged or blocked. The following projects will make controlling and monitoring IoT devices within your home easier, safer and more private.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** | Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first - 1500+ integrations. Runs well on a Raspberry Pi, accessible though a web interface and CLI, as well as several controller apps (such as [HassKit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thhkstudio.hasskit) and the official [Home Assistant App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android))
**[OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org)** | A vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home, with 2000+ supported devices and addons. Works well on a Raspberry Pi, or low-powered home server, and again there are some great apps for, such as the official [OpenHabb App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid) and the [HomeHabit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.homehabit.view) wall dashboard
**[Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com)** | Another home automation system, Domoticz is more geared towards connecting and monitoring sensors within your space. Allows you to monitor your environment without anyone but you having access to the data
**[Node-RED](https://nodered.org)** | Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services, it provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to build flows with a wide range of supported nodes, and it is easy to deploy locally in your network

#### Notable Mentions 
For creating dashboard from IoT devices, see [ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io). Another home automation tool is [FHEM](https://fhem.de/fhem.html), which has been around for a while and needs a bit more work to get up and running, but is still a popular option.

#### Word of Warning
IoT smart home devices can open you up to many security risks and exploits. It is really important that you configure them correctly, setting strong unique passwords, turn off data sharing, and if possible restrict internet access so devices can only communicate within your local network. See [Smart Home Security Checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist#smart-home) for more tips.

## Code Hosting

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
[SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/) | Git and mercurial code hosting, task management, mailing lists, wiki hosting and Alpine-based build pipelines. Can be self-hosted, or used through the managed instance at [sr.ht](https://sr.ht/)
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) | A fully-managed instance of [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org)

## AI Voice Assistants

Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri don't have the best [reputation](https://srlabs.de/bites/smart-spies) when it comes to protecting consumers privacy, there have been [many recent breaches](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924886/alexa-google-home-security-vulnerability-srlabs-phishing-eavesdropping). For that reason it is recommended not to have these devices in your house. The following are open source AI voice assistants, that aim to provide a human voice interface while also protecting your privacy and security

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai)** | An open source privacy-respecting AI platform, that runs on many platforms (Raspberry Pi, desktop, or dedicated Mycroft device). It is in active development, with thorough documentation and a broad range of available skills, but also Mycroft makes it really easy to develop new skills
**[Kalliope](https://kalliope-project.github.io)** | An open source, modular always-on voice controlled personal assistant designed for home automation. It runs well on Raspberry Pi, Debian or Ubuntu and is easy to program with simple YAML-based skills, but does not have a wide library of pre-built add-ons

#### Notable Mentions
If you choose to continue using Google Home/ Alexa, then check out **[Project Alias](https://github.com/bjoernkarmann/project_alias)**. It's a small app that runs on a Pi, and gives you more control over your smart assistants, for both customisation and privacy.

For a desktop-based assistant, see [Dragonfire](https://github.com/DragonComputer/Dragonfire) for Ubuntu, and [Jarvis](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis) for MacOS.  [LinTO](https://linto.ai), [Jovo](https://www.jovo.tech) and [Snips](https://snips.ai) are private-by-design voice assistant frameworks that can be built on by developers, or used by enterprises. [Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io), [Stephanie](https://github.com/SlapBot/stephanie-va) and [Hey Athena](https://github.com/rcbyron/hey-athena-client) are Python-based voice assistant, but neither is under active development anymore. See also [OpenAssistant](https://openassistant.org).

#### Word of Warning
If you are building your own assistant, you may want to consider a hardware-switch for disabling the microphone. Keep tabs on issues and check the code, to ensure you are happy with how it works, from a privacy perspective.

## Final Notes

### Conclusion

Many corporations put profit before people, collecting data and exploiting privacy. They claim to be secure but without being open source it can't be verified, until there's been a breach and it's too late. Switching to privacy-respecting open source software will drastically help improving your security, privacy and anonymity online.

However, that's not all you need to do. It is also important to : use strong and unique passwords, 2-factor authentication,
adopt good networking practices and be mindful of data that are collected when browsing the web. You can see the full
**[personal security checklist](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/master/README.md)** for more tips to stay safe. 


### Important Considerations

**Compartmentalise, Update and Be Ready**<br>
No piece of software is truly secure or private.  Further to this, software can only as secure as the system it is running on. Vulnerabilities are being discovered and patched all the time, so you much keep your system up-to-date. Breaches occur regularly, so compartmentalise your data to minimise damage. It's not just about choosing secure software, you must also follow good security practices.

**Attack Surface**<br>
It is a good idea to keep your trusted software base small, to reduce potential attack surface. At the same time trusting a single application for too many tasks or too much personal data could be a weakness in your system. So you will need to judge the situation according to your threat model, and carefully plan which software and applications you trust with each segment of your data.

**Convenience Vs Security**<br>
There is often a trade-off between convenience and security. Construct a threat model, and choose a balance that is right for you. In a similar way in some situations there is privacy and security conflict (e.g. Find My Phone is great for security, but terrible for privacy, and anonymous payments may be good for privacy but less secure than insured fiat currency). Again it is about assessing your situation, understanding the risks and making an informed decision.

**Hosted Vs Self-Hosted Considerations**<br>
When using a hosted or managed application that is open-source software - there is often no easy way to tell if the version running is the same as that of the published source code (even published signatures can be faked). There is always the possibility that additional backdoors may have been knowingly or unknowingly implemented in the running instance. One way round this is to self-host software yourself. When self-hosting you will then know for sure which code is running, however you will also be responsible for the managing security of the server, and so may not be recommended for beginners.

**Open Source Software Considerations**<br>
Open source software has long had a reputation of being more secure than its closed source counterparts. Since bugs are raised transparently, fixed quickly, the code can be checked by experts in the community and there is usually little or no data collection or analytics. 
That being said, there is no piece of software that it totally bug free, and hence never truly secure or private. Being open source, is in no way a guarantee that something is safe. There is no shortage of poorly-written, obsolete or sometimes harmful open source projects on the internet. Some open source apps, or a dependency bundled within it are just plain malicious (such as, that time [Colourama was found in the PyPI Repository](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/31/when-good-software-goes-bad-malware-in-open-source/))

**Proprietary Software Considerations**<br>
When using a hosted or proprietary solution - always check the privacy policy, research the reputation of the organisation, and be weary about which data you trust them with. It may be best to choose open source software for security-critical situations, where possible.

**Maintenance**<br>
When selecting a new application, ensure it is still being regularly maintained, as this will allow for recently discovered security issues to be addressed. Software in an alpha or beta phase, may be buggy and lacking in features, but  more importantly - it could have critical vulnerabilities open to exploit. Similarly, applications that are no longer being actively maintained may pose a security risk, due to lack of patching. When using a forked application, or software that is based on an upstream code base, be aware that it may receive security-critical patches and updates at a slightly later date than the original application. 

**This List: Disclaimer**<br>
This list contains packages that range from entry-level to advanced, a lot of the software here will not be appropriate for all audiences. It is in no way a definitive list of secure applications, and aims only to be a guide, a collection of software and services that myself and other contributors have used, and would recommend. There will always be new vulnerabilities discovered or introduced, bugs and security-critical glitches, malicious actors and poorly configured systems. It is up to you to do your research, draw up a threat model, and decide where and how your data are managed.

If you find something on this list that should no longer be deemed secure or private/ or should have a warning note attached, please raise an issue. In the same way if you know of something that is missing, or would like to make an edit, then pull requests are welcome, and are much appreciated!
